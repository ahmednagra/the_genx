After decades of waiting, the son God promised Abraham and Sarah has been born. Isaac is Abraham’s only son, and he loves him dearly (22:2a). But God makes an impossible-sounding request of Abraham in order to test him (22:2b). God tells Abraham to go to a mountain called Moriah and sacrifice his only son Isaac. 

By faith, Abraham trusted that God would do something to make this right (Heb 11:19). 

He took his son to Mount Moriah, built an altar, and bound his son (22:9). With a knife in his hand, Abraham was about to sacrifice his son. But God stopped him by calling out to him. And when Abraham looked around, he saw a ram caught in a thicket which he then took and sacrificed in Isaac’s place. 

What was spoken in faith by Abraham before they went up on the mountain proved true: “God will provide for himself the lamb” (22:8). 

Where is the Gospel? 

What should stop us dead in our tracks is this: what God did not require of Abraham, he required of himself. Even though Abraham’s son was spared on that day, we know that God’s son, Jesus, was not (Rom 8:32). 

Even more so than Isaac, Jesus was the special and unique son of God (John 3:16). Even more so than Isaac, Jesus was the promised son from the line of Eve and Abraham. Even more so than Isaac, Jesus was the son through whom all nations would be blessed and God’s plan would be realized. 

Many ask a similar question in light of both this story and the cross. How could God allow Jesus to be killed? 

It was not a test for God, as it was for Abraham. God did not need to be tested. Instead, it was a testament to us. Just as Abraham being willing to sacrifice his son demonstrated his fear of God, Jesus sacrificing himself demonstrates God’s love for us (Rom 5:8). God loves us so much that he was willing to do for us what he did not even require Abraham to do. 

In the words of Abraham, God provided for himself the lamb. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who always provides a substitute for us when we need it most, and that you would see Jesus as the unique son of God who was not spared, but gave his life for yours."

The opening chapters of Genesis talk about the creation of the world. But what they show us is how God is different from all other gods of the ancient world. 

The Jewish people weren’t the only ones with a story about how the world was made. And one of the things Genesis 1-2 are doing is setting the one true God apart from false gods.  

In other cultures’ creation accounts, the gods do terrible, immoral things that cause the universe to be created almost by accident. 

The one true God, however, creates the world on purpose, out of his purity, and simply by speaking his word (1:3). 

In pagan religions, different gods were over the sky and the sea and the land. 

The one true God is the maker of all of these (1:10). 

In pagan religions, humans are also the result of the gods’ accidental actions. 

The one true God creates humans intentionally and makes them in his image (1:26). 

Other creation myths from this time portray women as less than men or even a curse to men. But in Genesis, God creates both man and woman in his image (1:27). In fact, the only time God says something is not good in these first two chapters is when he says that it is not good for man to be without woman (2:18). Also, unlike the pagan gods who want nothing to do with the humans, the one true God tells the first humans why they exist. Their purpose is to multiply and fill the earth (2:15). By doing so, they would take God’s image and cover the whole world with his presence. All the while, they would enjoy God’s provision and presence in the garden. 

Finally, unlike the pagan gods who are always causing more trouble with their never-ending evil work, the one true God rests after he has finished creating because all the work is done (2:2). 

The opening of the Bible gives us a picture of the world and of God unlike anything else that man-made religions could come up with.

Where is the Gospel? 

Remarkably, the New Testament takes it one step further. It tells us that everything we read about in Genesis was actually created by the Word of God who became flesh in Jesus (Jn 1:1). 

The God who made humans in his image is the God who came in the image of humans. 

God coming to us in flesh and blood is ultimately what separates Christianity from every other religion. In every other religion, we are separated from God or gods or the spiritual realm and must perform a certain set of rituals or good deeds to get to them. 

But in Genesis 1, we see that our God is different. He who made everything, not only makes us in his image, but he makes himself in ours. He comes to us and fulfills the purpose given to Adam and Eve (Mat. 28:19) so we can return to the garden and be in God’s presence. By doing so, God offers us the rest he experienced on the seventh day of creation because all our work is complete in Jesus (Heb 4:9-10). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you a God who is different from anything else in the universe and that you would see Jesus as the Word who spoke all things into existence, who also became like us so that he might bring us God’s presence and fill the earth with his image. "

Joshua has obediently and faithfully driven the Canaanites from Israel’s homeland. By this time he is old, and there is still a lot of unconquered land (Joshua 13:1). But God commands Joshua to divide the land among the tribes of Israel, as if it had already been conquered (Joshua 13:7). 

The first allotments focus on one man and one tribe—Caleb and the tribe of Judah. 

Back in Numbers, when Israel was first ready to enter Canaan, Caleb and Joshua were the only spies who trusted God and did not fear the inhabitants of the land (Numbers 13:30). For his faithfulness, God promised Caleb the land he spied out (Numbers 14:24). Now Joshua honors Caleb’s faithfulness and God’s promise by giving him his reward (Joshua 14:13). 

The first tribe to receive their land is Judah (Joshua 15:1). Judah is also given more land than any other tribe. This repeats a pattern from Genesis when Jacob blesses Judah more than his brothers (Genesis 49:8). And in Numbers Judah is given a prominent position around the tabernacle (Numbers 2:3). As Israel settles in the land, Judah is again elevated among the other tribes of Israel. 

But one significant detail makes Israel’s possession of the land seem uneasy. As the tribes enter into their allotted land, they’re unable to drive out the remaining Canaanites (Joshua 15:63). 

Where is the Gospel?

Ultimately, Jesus fulfills both Caleb and Judah’s hope for a homeland. 

The giants that Caleb fearlessly conquered in the land allotted to him were the descendants of the Nephilim (Numbers 13:33). They were part of the reason God sent the great flood (Genesis 6:4). Caleb’s victory over these powers prepares us for Jesus as the new and better Caleb (Joshua 15:14). 

As Jesus and his Kingdom spread across the promised land, he drove out demons and healed the sick, conquering territory that wicked spiritual beings had taken (Matthew 4:23). But Jesus not only conquered evil in one territory like Caleb, he triumphed over all sin and all enemies around the world (Ephesians 1:21). Unlike Joshua, whose victory waned in the hour of his death, Jesus triumphed over evil and sin specifically in the hour of his death (Colossians 2:15). And his rule over evil continues forever by nature of his resurrection. 

Jesus is also the very reason Judah is elevated throughout Scripture, since Jesus is from the tribe of Judah! Judah gives us hope in the middle of unconquered lands. Jesus, the ultimate Judean, emerged from this tribe and conquers every pocket of evil in the world. He brings peace to God’s people on every side (Genesis 49:10). Like Judah and Caleb, in Jesus we have been promised both peace and a home in his Kingdom.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who keeps his promises even when we don’t keep ours. And may see Jesus as the one who conquers all evil in his death and resurrection."

God will not sacrifice his people but himself in Jesus.",Website,Zephaniah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

When God first made the earth, we’re told he singled out two creatures to image his moral purity, love, and generosity to the world (Genesis 1:28). God chose humanity to be the only image of God. But in pride, the first carriers of God’s image abdicated their call. That day led to the world’s ruin (Genesis 3:16-19). The prophet Zephaniah warns history is about to repeat itself. On a day in the near future, God will raise up an empire to end the pride, violence, and idolatry of both Judah and the rest of the world’s leaders. Zephaniah calls that day the “Day of the Lord'' (Zephaniah 1:7). It’s a day when God will visit the earth—not to create it, but to undo it. God will uncreate all his images that have failed to image him (Genesis 1:26; Zephaniah 1:3).

As a nation Judah was supposed to image God’s purity, love, and generosity to a watching world but it has failed (Zephaniah 1:4). Instead, her people set up shrines to the stars, and bowed to images of the gods Baal and Molech (Zephaniah 1:5-6). God’s chosen nation has abdicated her call, and her failure will ruin the earth again. The first time God’s images failed like this God sacrificed an animal to signal he would still be faithful (Genesis 3:21). But now God says he will make a sacrifice out of his people (Zephaniah 1:8). On the Day of the Lord, God will consume kings, princes, and leaders like a sacrificial meal (Zephaniah 1:9-13). 

Practically, the Day of the Lord’s decreation and sacrifice will come through war (Zephaniah 1:14). Soon the Babylonian empire will be the agent of God’s anger on Judah and all other nations who have copied Jerusalem’s idolatrous ingratitude and pride (Zephaniah 1:15-16). On God’s day of war, trauma will blind the world as Babylon’s armies disembowel and drain their victims of their blood (Zephaniah 1:17). God’s burning passion will consume the earth through Babylon’s armies (Zephaniah 1:18). 

But this inevitable day of destruction for the world doesn’t mean the destruction of all God’s people. Zephaniah’s prophecy is a warning to those willing to listen (Zephaniah 2:1-2). Yes, the world as they know it will end and Judah will fall. But during the Day of the Lord, the humble will be protected (Zephaniah 2:3). 

Where is the Gospel?

We’re told that Zephaniah prophesied during the time of Josiah (Zephaniah 1:1). Josiah, found a long-lost copy of God’s laws and realized, to his horror, the extent of Judah’s sins (2 Kings 22:13). Immediately, Josiah tore down the images of other gods. But Josiah’s willingness to represent God’s moral purity, love, and generosity would only save Josiah (2 Kings 22:16). It would not stop the inevitable Day of the Lord against Judah’s accumulated failings (2 Kings 22:19). Babylon was still coming. Apparently, the sins of a representative few can indict entire nations—and even all of humanity. But the obedience of a good king only lasts for a generation. 

Josiah couldn’t save his kingdom, but Jesus has. Jesus accepted his role to image God’s moral purity, love, and generosity to the world (Hebrews 1:3). He refused to abdicate that call even when it meant becoming a sacrifice for his people (Luke 22:42). And like a righteously angry warrior, Jesus went to war against idolatry and pride on the cross. The wartime terror of Zephaniah’s judgments all came true (Matthew 27:51-52a). They were not meted out by Jesus on his people, but on himself. He allows the armies of Rome to blind his eyes in death and drain his body of blood so that we would know God’s burning passion was entirely consumed. God will no longer undo creation because the Creator was undone for us. God will not sacrifice his people because he has sacrificed himself. Jesus experienced the Day of the Lord so the humble can be protected.

Jesus saves his Kingdom where Josiah failed because Jesus rose from the dead. Josiah’s obedience protected his life, but Jesus’ obedience protects even after death. Jesus cannot die again. Just as chaos, ruin, and death entered the world through the sins of a representative few, Jesus’ resurrection represents the hope of the world (1 Corinthians 15:20-22). Jesus is just the first to be protected from the Day of the Lord by resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:23). Everyone who accepts the call to extend God’s image is invited to enter a recreated world where neither pride nor death live anymore (1 Corinthians 15:24-25).

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who brings destruction. And may you see Jesus as the one who is consumed and sacrificed so that the humble inherit his Kingdom. "

Joshua continues to divide up the land and assigns the rest to the remaining 11 tribes. 

Joseph’s tribe is the next to receive their land. Back in Genesis, this tribe was split into two, each named after Joseph’s two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh (Genesis 48:5). Half the tribe of Manasseh, along with Reuben and Gad, had decided to settle outside Canaan, east of the Jordan River (Numbers 32:5). But Ephraim and the other half of Manasseh are assigned their plots and given land near the center of the nation.

Immediately there are problems.

First, Joseph’s tribe did not completely drive out God’s enemies like they were supposed to (Joshua 16:10). Second, they complain that their land is too small (Joshua 17:14). They ask Joshua to give them more land than God originally allotted. 

The problem wasn’t that their allotment was too small, but that they were too afraid to drive out the Canaanites (Joshua 17:16). If they want the land, they need to trust God’s power and take it (Joshua 17:18). 

Where is the Gospel?

Though God has led Israel to take over much of the land, they do not end up trusting him to finish what he started (Joshua 17:13). 

The reason for this lack of trust is fear. Joseph’s descendants were afraid of the strong Canaanites and their iron chariots (Joshua 17:16). They didn’t trust that God would lead them to victory like he had before. 

But Joshua tells Ephraim and Manasseh that they can successfully drive out the Canaanites despite their numbers, advanced weaponry, or strategic military positioning (Joshua 17:18). After all, Israel’s victories had never been a result of size or strategy, but of God’s power. 

Jesus also defeated strong and well-armed enemies: sin and death. He did so not by overpowering them with force or numbers, but by dying and rising again through God’s power (Colossians 2:15). 

In the same way, Israel should have looked back on God’s victory in the past to strengthen their trust in him for the future. We, too, can look back to Jesus’ decisive victory over death. We can trust that not even the strength of death and the sting of the grave will gain victory over us (1 Corinthians 15:57). 

Instead, we will take possession of the land our enemies try to take from us. Through faith in Jesus we will inhabit a plentiful and spacious land in the new heaven and new earth (Revelation 21:1-2). It is a land that will be completely pure (Revelation 21:27), where no outpost or pocket of evil can remain (Revelation 22:3). 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is mighty in battle despite our enemy’s strength or our weakness. And may you see Jesus as the one who died in weakness to grant us eternal strength over our greatest enemy."

While Achan's disobedience caused death, Jesus' obedience secures eternal life.",Website,Joshua Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Israel is about to march against the fortress town of Ai—twice. And the first time is a disaster.

Before the battle we’re told that Achan, a soldier, has stolen some of Jericho’s treasure (Joshua 7:1). God warned them that if they stole anything devoted to him, they would be devoted to destruction (Joshua 6:18). And God makes good on his promise. Israel is routed at Ai and terrified that the God who was for them is now against them (Joshua 7:4-5). 

Joshua doesn’t know about Achan’s theft. So he asks God why he didn’t fight alongside them at Ai like he did in Jericho (Joshua 7:9). 

God tells him that Israel has already forgotten that this battle is not theirs to win. These conflicts aren’t about Israel getting richer, they’re about God keeping his promises to bring the Garden of Eden back to the earth. Someone forgot this and stole treasure from Jericho, the way Eve took the fruit. When Joshua finds the man responsible, Achan even offers the same explanation for his sin that Eve did—it just looked good to him (Joshua 7:21). Now the whole camp is in danger (Joshua 7:11). Not wanting to repeat the curse of Eden, they stone and burn Achan just as they burned down Jericho (Joshua 7:25).

Quickly, they return the Lord’s devoted things to the tabernacle, and God tells Joshua to take Ai in an ambush (Joshua 8:1-2). Joshua is to stretch out his javelin over Ai like Moses stretched out his staff over the Red Sea (Exodus 14:16; Joshua 8:18). And as the water swallowed the Egyptian army, Israel’s forces swallow the armies of Ai (Joshua 8:22). Unlike Achan, their obedience brings blessing.  

Joshua then calls Israel together between the mountains of Ebal and Gerizim to worship God and remind them of the covenant (Joshua 8:30-31). Just as the two battles of Ai offer pictures of God’s covenant blessings and covenant curses, these mountains represent the same. From one mountain the covenant blessings are declared over the people, and from the other the curses are pronounced (Joshua 8:33-34). 

Where is the Gospel?

God tells Joshua that he will not be with Israel unless everything devoted to destruction is destroyed (Joshua 7:12). For God’s covenant of blessing to remain, all Israel needs to obey—no exceptions. The sin of just one man will curse the whole (Romans 5:17). 

But the opposite is also true. When Achan was judged for his disobedience, all Israel was blessed with victory. 

In the New Testament, Paul tells us this isn’t just true for Israel, but for all creation. Because of Adam and Eve’s one sin, all of creation is cursed (Romans 5:12). 

Just as Eve took the beautiful fruit and Achan took the beautiful treasure, we also prefer to take what we think of as beautiful or good—even when God commands us not to. Like Achan and Eve, we devote ourselves and those around us to destruction.

But Paul goes on to say that while this is true, the opposite is true of Jesus on the cross (Romans 5:15). Jesus did not take the “beautiful or the “easy” path; he did what God said despite the cost (Matthew 26:39). Jesus obeyed even when it meant taking responsibility for our sin and being devoted to our deserved destruction (Romans 5:19). 

Even more powerfully than Achan’s sin threatened Israel, Jesus’ perfection saves us all. While Achan’s disobedience caused death and a curse, Jesus’ obedience brings about blessing and life (Romans 5:21). 

When we trust that Jesus was destroyed for our Achan-like tendencies, we can confidently rise up and expect Israel-like victory. The Garden of Eden—God’s Kingdom—will come. It will destroy our sin and like Israel hoped we will live with God forever.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who devotes the disobedient to destruction. And may you see Jesus as the one who devotes himself to destruction so that the disobedient might have life."

Israel is finally settling in her homeland. Her enemies are largely defeated and the 12 tribes have been allotted their land. There are just two loose ends to be tied up before God’s promise to give them this land is complete.

First, God commanded Moses to set up cities of refuge in the promised land (Numbers 35:9-10). If someone accidentally kills their neighbor, they can run to one of the cities of refuge for justice and protection (Numbers 35:12). 

The other loose end is the priestly tribe of Levi’s inheritance (Joshua 21:1). Levi had three sons who were the leaders of three clans—Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. These clans, along with the descendants of the high priest Aaron, are not promised large tracts of land like the other 12 tribes. Instead, they are told God will be their inheritance (Numbers 18:20). As they take care of the temple they can depend on God’s provision through the offerings and sacrifices made by the other 12 tribes (Deuteronomy 18:3). 

Even the land they lived in is to be a gift from the other 12 tribes (Numbers 35:2). The tribes, in a sense, sacrifice a bit of their own land to provide for the Levites (Joshua 21:3). The Levites are also given the cities of refuge (Joshua 21:13).

The Levites, as God’s priestly representatives, aren’t concentrated in one place but are spread out among the tribes. In every tribe there are Levites who teach God’s commands, execute justice, protect the innocent, and mediate between God and people (Malachi 2:7). 

Where is the Gospel?

In a book all about fighting for a place, getting land, and settling in a home, what does it mean to not get any of that? For people who will never have a home, what does it mean to have a home in the Lord?

For the Levites it meant that instead of living in their own tribal land, they dispersed to every tribe’s land. And instead of farming and growing their own food, it was sacrificially given to them by others. Instead of looking after their own property, the Levites looked after God’s people. The Levites didn’t guard borders, but as they taught Israel to obey God’s commands and enacted justice in the land, they guarded the soul of their nation. That’s what it meant to have the Lord as an inheritance.

Jesus is a priest like these Levites (1Timothy 2:5). His Kingdom isn’t bound to a certain patch of land; Jesus is the priest for the whole earth. He’s not interested in marking boundaries because his Kingdom isn’t of this world (John 18:36). Jesus is more concerned with guarding the souls of his people. So instead of promising land, Jesus promises us a place in God (John 14:3). And even more immediately, he makes a place for God in us (John 16:13). We are now God’s homeland as we wait for our home in Him. Jesus makes our inheritance in God an eternal reality. 

Instead of being fed by sacrifices, Jesus becomes a sacrifice for us (1 Peter 3:18). Jesus provides forever what the homeless Levites tasted in part—peace with God and peace with one another. For those who don’t feel like they have a home, God is your home through Jesus. He is always with you.

And like God sent the Levites as his representatives throughout all of Israel, Jesus now sends you to be his representatives throughout all the earth (Matthew 28:19). We are now a nation of Levites enacting justice, protecting the innocent, and teaching the good news of our eternal homeland in God (Revelation 1:6).

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who gives us his presence and protection personally and through representatives. And may you see Jesus as God himself, who comes to us wherever we are with presence and protection."

The walls of Jericho are about to come down. Jericho was a strategic and powerful city. Israel would not be able to enter into the promised land with Jericho still standing. 

But instead of going to war, God tells Joshua that the fall of Jericho is a gift (Joshua 6:2). Israel’s army is not to be led by soldiers, but by the ark of God’s presence and seven priests (Joshua 6:4). And after seven days of simply marching around the city, with no siegeworks built or swords drawn, the walls of Jericho miraculously fall. It is not by the might of Israel’s soldiers but by the power of God (Joshua 6:5).

Joshua tells his soldiers that their victory is because God has devoted Jericho to destruction (Joshua 6:17). And even though the city is a gift, the soldiers are not permitted to take any spoils of war for themselves. They’re even warned that if they do, Israel will be devoted to destruction instead (Joshua 6:18). Nothing can be left alive or used for Israel’s benefit (Joshua 6:21). 

All of this shows that this battle is not primarily a military campaign. This battle is about worship and devotion to God. The only people not devoted to destruction are Rahab’s family. Unlike Jericho’s leaders, her family devote themselves to God when they protect Israel’s spies (Joshua 6:23). Because of their faith Rahab and her family are made honorary Israelites (Joshua 6:25).

The fall of Jericho proves that God is with Joshua and that he is fighting God’s battles. Joshua’s fame quickly spreads throughout Canaan (Joshua 6:27).

Where is the Gospel?

This is not the last time we will hear of an entire town being “devoted to destruction.” The entire land of Canaan is devoted in this same way. Similarly, everyone devoted to God lives. But those who choose not to devote themselves to God are devoted to destruction. 

The Apostle John says something remarkably similar about Jesus: “Whoever believes in [God’s Son] shall not perish but have eternal life… Whoever does not believe stands condemned already… Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil” (John 3:16, 18-19).

When God’s people showed up in Canaan, Rahab saw the light of God’s faithfulness to his people and believed in God. The rest of Jericho, however, preferred their darkness. They chose to fortify their position, shut themselves in, and fight rather than devote themselves to the Lord (Joshua 6:1).

Our world is condemned already. It is devoted to destruction. But the good news is that God so loved the world he gave us his only son, Jesus. If we, like Rahab, believe and devote ourselves to him, we become part of his people. We escape destruction and gain life in his eternal kingdom.

Yes, these passages are difficult to read. But when we trust Jesus, reading about the destruction in Joshua is the closest we will ever come to experiencing it.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who devotes his enemies to destruction. And may you see Jesus as the one who rescues us from our devotion to destruction and darkness."

Israel is preparing for holy war. The Canaanites have invaded and desecrated Israel’s ancestral homeland. God gave this land to Israel and it’s time to take it back (Genesis 15:18). And since this military campaign cannot be separated from God’s promises and the moral corruption the Canaanites brought into the land (Leviticus 18:25), the army needs to prepare itself appropriately. The men needed to circumcise themselves and celebrate the Passover (Joshua 5:2, 10). 

Circumcision was an outward sign that they trusted God’s promise to give them the land. Compared to the generation before them that disobeyed and died in the wilderness, this new generation of Israelites is radically—even painfully—obedient (Joshua 5:9). The continuation of God’s centuries-old promise to give Abraham’s descendants the land of Canaan is finally coming true (Genesis 17:8).

As soon as the men are healed, they celebrate Passover in their new homeland (Joshua 5:10). In Egypt, the Passover marked Israel as a nation distinctly and specially protected by God (Exodus 7:5). Observing it in Canaan proved the same point.

And as final proof that Israel’s is ready to enter their ancestral land, the manna that fed them in the wilderness stops falling as soon as they eat the fruit that grows in their rightful home (Joshua 5:12). 

Suddenly, a man with a drawn sword appears to Joshua out of nowhere (Joshua 5:13). Joshua wants to know if he is on his side or the side of Joshua’s enemy. But the man says he is for neither because he is the “commander of the army of the Lord” (Joshua 5:13).

Just like circumcision is a symbol of God’s promises, and the Passover is a reminder of God’s protection, this commander reveals that the battles Joshua is about to fight are not about his political ambitions. They are about God being faithful to his promises. God is the true Commander of Israel’s armies, not Joshua. Joshua’s only response is to bow before this ruler (Joshua 5:14-15).  

Where is the Gospel?

God reveals himself as Israel’s Commander who will lead them into his Kingdom and defeat his enemies. 

That faithful Commander is ultimately Jesus. Just as Joshua’s battle was not tied to political ambition, Jesus’ Kingdom is not tied to this world (John 18:36). Jesus prepares us to do battle against our enemies (Ephesians 6:12). He circumcises our hearts, not our bodies (Colossians 2:11). Our transformed hearts are now inward signs that God’s promises to bring his promised land to earth will come true (Colossians 2:11). And by Jesus’ blood on the cross, death passes over us just as it passed over Israel’s bloody doors in Egypt (John 1:29). 

Jesus is our Commanding Officer and he has prepared us for a new and spiritual holy war. This war is not about taking over a nation and demanding its citizens become Christians. It’s about the power of the Holy Spirit pushing back the darkness of our world. 

The good news of Jesus is even better than the good news of Joshua! Jesus has already defeated our enemies (John 16:33). He has already overcome the world. The forces of darkness are on the way out. And the God who is in us is greater than the demonic forces left in the world (1 John 4:4). 

Because of Jesus, our great Commanding Officer, we don’t need to be afraid of our world—its darkness, armies, or politics. Jesus is on God’s side, and no matter how much the powers of this world fight, his Kingdom will most certainly come. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who fights for his people. And may you see Jesus as our Commanding Officer who leads us into a battle we cannot lose."

Before Joshua led Israel into Canaan, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh asked Moses for an inheritance in Gilead on the other side of the Jordan in the wilderness (Numbers 32:5). Technically, Gilead is outside the promised land. But these tribes agreed to fight in Canaan and only then return across the Jordan to their inheritance. Moses agreed to the arrangement (Numbers 32:18). 

Their time to go home had finally come (Joshua 22:2, 6)!

But something unexpected happens. The two-and-a-half tribes build an altar to God next to the Jordan River (Joshua 22:10).

The rest of the tribes are highly offended (Joshua 22:16). The Law of Moses forbade any sacrificial altar other than the one in the tabernacle (Deuteronomy 12:12-14). In fact, Israel’s conquest tore down other altars in the land (Deuteronomy 12:2). It looked like these tribes were setting up a forbidden altar inside God’s land (Joshua 22:11).

The leaders of Israel travel out to meet them, ready to continue their holy war against their own people if necessary (Joshua 22:12). The Israelites believe that if they let this altar remain, God will judge the whole nation (Joshua 22:20). 

But it’s all a misunderstanding. The two-and-a-half tribes explain that they did not build the altar for sacrifices, but as a sign (Joshua 22:26-27). With the boundary of the Jordan between them, they feared that future Israelites in the promised land would cut them off from God’s tabernacle (Joshua 22:25). They built the altar as a reminder that the two-and-a-half tribes across the Jordan are still part of God’s people, and still live in God’s land (Joshua 22:28). 

Where is the Gospel?

At the same boundary between the promised land and Gilead—and in the same place where the altar was built—Jesus was baptized (Matthew 3:13). He traveled from the promised land, up to the boundary of the Jordan, and then into the wilderness (Matthew 4:1). And it was from his place outside the promised land, beyond the Jordan, that Jesus began to preach about his Kingdom (Matthew 4:15-17). 

Jesus chose those locations intentionally. He was revealing a truth that the two-and-a-half tribes hinted at with their altar—that access to God will not be just for Israel, but for all nations outside Canaan’s border (Isaiah 60:3). 

And Jesus is the one acceptable altar of God (Acts 4:12). The sacrifice of his body on the cross not only destroyed sin and death, but division and exclusion (Ephesians 2:14). No matter where you are from, you need not fear that you won’t be included in God’s people or will somehow lose access to God, like the two-and-a-half tribes feared. 

Jesus’ sacrifice is a sign that anyone who puts their faith in him will be brought into God’s presence (Matthew 27:51).

May the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who makes a way for all nations to draw close to him. May you see Jesus as the final altar around whom all people may come."

Zephaniah prophecies that God will soon purify the world with fire (Zephaniah 3:8). And in the place of evil and pride, a holy and humble minority will experience God’s love and safety (Zephaniah 3:17). 

In particular, God will cleanse the speech of the world (Zephaniah 3:9). After the fire, humanity will no longer speak arrogantly like the proud nations around them. But in deference and humility, they will honor God and serve him as one united people (Zephaniah 3:8). Everyone who God once scattered across the earth will return and worship him with their words and speech (Zephaniah 3:10).

After the arrogant are removed, Jerusalem will act as a new city for the world’s humble minority, never to be conquered again (Zephaniah 3:11-12). Everyone who lives inside the walls of this new Jerusalem will honor God because their tongues will be purged of deceit and filled with truth (Zephaniah 3:13a). Never again will Jerusalem need to fear judgment or fire because every arrogant power has either been turned back or turned into a fellow humble friend (Zephaniah 3:14-15).

After the fire, God will come near his people to comfort them. In joy he will sing over the humble, and in love he will quiet the anxious (Zephaniah 3:17). God’s song promises an end to pride and arrogance (Zephaniah 3:18). God sings of restoration to the lame and honor to the disgraced and outcast (Zephaniah 3:19). And finally, God promises to publicly gather his holy and humble people into a new home, where none can deny what God has done for them (Zephaniah 3:20).

Where is the Gospel?

Early in world history, the peoples of the earth were united under one language (Genesis 11:1). But humanity used their common speech to defy God and his plan to spread his people and promises throughout the earth (Genesis 11:4). In justified anger, God multiplied their languages and prevented humanity from uniting under a common tongue of human pride (Genesis 11:6-7, 9). Unfortunately, every country and people developed new languages and ways to defy God and oppress the humble. But Zephaniah predicts the humble will finally be safe after another day of fire falls to undo the proud speech of the earth. 

That day of fire occurred 50 days after Jesus died— the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:3). As Zephaniah prophesied, a scattered minority from all over the earth were gathered in Jerusalem (Acts 2:5). God appeared, not in a jealous fire to destroy proud speech, but as tongues of fire speaking good news in languages understood by all (Acts 2:3-4, 6). Purged of deceit and filled with truth, God’s new holy and humble minority proclaimed the good news that Jesus rose from the dead (Acts 2:22-24). In joy and in love, God’s tongue of fire quieted the humble in Jerusalem with songs of peace and victory. 

We still need this comfort, which is why it’s good news that Zephaniah prophesied that God would come near to comfort his humble people. One of Jesus’ names is Immanuel, or God with us (Matthew 1:23). And as the tongues of fire proved, Jesus is not simply near us, but in us. We are filled with his Holy Spirit. The apostle John calls him the Comforter whose role is to give us peace (John 14:26-27). So if you are willing to humble yourself, if you are willing to admit that your pride or power cannot achieve what you desire, if you are willing to admit that Jesus has risen from the dead, then God will sing over you this truth: you are now a citizen of an eternal Kingdom absent of arrogance, enemies, and death.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who speaks through fire. And may you see Jesus as the Comforter who quiets your soul with songs of his love. "

As Israel takes back their ancestral homeland, news of Joshua’s victories spreads. The remaining kings in Canaan form an alliance to take out Joshua and Israel (Joshua 9:2). But the Gibeonites refuse to participate. Like Rahab, they had heard of what God did in Egypt, as well as to the kings Sihon and Og across the Jordan River (Joshua 9:9-10). And just as Rahab’s lie protected the spies and her family, the Gibeonites lie to save their people and gain a place in God’s land (Joshua 9:4). 

They disguise themselves as emissaries from a kingdom far in the north and outside the promised land. They ask Israel to make a covenant with them (Joshua 9:6). They will become their servants if Israel allows them to live (Joshua 9:11). And Joshua agrees (Joshua 9:15).

But three days later he finds out they have been tricked (Joshua 9:16). 

Joshua can’t break his promise (Joshua 9:19). But his treaty with the Gibeonites threatens Israel’s covenant with God. When Joshua demands an explanation, the Gibeonites explain that they knew Canaan was Israel’s ancestral home, and they’re confident God would give it to Israel (Joshua 9:24). The Gibeonites fear the true God of Canaan and know their only hope is to ask for mercy (Joshua 9:25).

Neither Rahab nor the Gibeonites are the first people in the Bible to resort to deception to secure God’s blessing. One of Israel’s founding fathers, Jacob (whose name literally means “trickster”), disguised himself as his brother and secured the blessing reserved for the firstborn Esau (Genesis 27:35). Israel’s inclusion in God’s covenant began with a trick, and now the Gibeonites, out of fear of the Lord, do the same. And it works. Throughout the rest of Scripture, Gibeon is counted as part of God’s people.

Where is the Gospel?

God promised Israel the land of Canaan, but it was never meant for just Israel.

God promised Abraham that through his offspring all the nations of the world would be blessed (Genesis 22:18). Gibeon is one of those nations. And just as the first father of Israel believed God and was promised to be the father of many nations through his offspring, Gibeon believes God and thus becomes part of God’s promise to Abraham (Genesis 15:6).

The Apostle Paul says that when Abraham believed God would give him his promised offspring, he was actually trusting in Jesus, even if he didn’t know his name (Galatians 3:16). Ultimately that’s why Gibeon’s deception works. When Gibeon quotes God’s promises to Abraham and pleads for Joshua’s mercy, they are really throwing themselves on the mercy of Jesus (Galatians 3:26, 29). That’s why even a group of lying Cannanites can become God’s people.

Like the Canaanites’ land, our lives belong to God. One day he will take it back. One day the grave will demand our destruction. God’s war path is inevitable. But the good news is that we don't have to trick God into accepting us into his eternal kingdom. We do not have to act like someone we are not or pretend we are better than we are. We don’t have to deny our nationality or ethnic heritage (Galatians 3:28). We become children of God and citizens of his Kingdom. We can own land in his new world. These promises won’t happen by pretending or hiding who we are, but by trusting God’s promises are true and that Jesus is powerful to bring them to pass.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who keeps his promises to those who trust in him. And may you see Jesus as the offspring of Abraham who saves all nations from destruction."

This section opens with one of the most important moments in all of Joshua: the tabernacle is set up and the land is subdued (Joshua 18:1). 

The land of Canaan was supposed to be Israel’s new garden of Eden—with her enemies defeated. The only thing left was for God’s presence to come. That’s why the tabernacle, the place where God’s presence was supposed to live, is so important. It marks the beginning of a new Eden. 

The connection to Eden is emphasized by the seven tribes that have yet to receive their inheritance (Joshua 18:2). Just as God created Eden in seven days and then rested (Genesis 2:2), so the seven tribes of Israel are given rest from war in their new Eden (Joshua 11:23). 

We’re also told the land lay subdued before them like Adam and Eve were commanded to subdue the earth and fill it (Genesis 1:28). As Israel subdues the land of Canaan, that command is being fulfilled!

God’s mission to create a new garden of Eden where he can fellowship with his people has come true, at least in part, through Israel. 

Where is Gospel?

Many years after Joshua, the prophet Ezekiel saw a vision of a time when God would allocate the land to Israel’s tribes again (Ezekiel 47:13). It would be a final land allotment that would bring about the final Eden. And the name of the city would be “The Lord Is There” (Ezekiel 48:35b). 

That city and the final garden of Eden comes in Jesus. The Apostle John uses the same words that open Genesis 1 to open his Gospel: “In the beginning...” (John 1:1). And just as Joshua and Ezekiel hoped that God would be with his people, whether in a new city or a new tabernacle, Jesus was God as he walked among us. His name even means “God with us” (Matthew 1:23). 

Like Joshua, Jesus came to a land conquered by sin and subdued its evil and enemies. He healed the sick. He liberated the oppressed. And he conquered sin as he rose from the dead.  Because of Jesus, there is nothing left but rest for citizens of his Kingdom.

And when Jesus returns, he will create the final and full garden of Eden (Revelation 22:2). In an act of new creation, Jesus will say, “ I am making all things new!” (Revelation 21:5). And he will subdue the whole earth, set up his presence instead of a tabernacle, allot land to his people, and give us eternal rest.

May the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who longs to dwell with us. And may you see Jesus as the one who subdues sin and death so that he can make all things new."

Throughout these first chapters, Joshua is compared to Moses. Like Moses, he’s called a servant of the Lord. He sends spies into the land of Canaan and commands the leaders of Israel’s tribes (Joshua 2:1, 8, 10). We’re told Joshua has the same “spirit of wisdom” Moses had (Deuteronomy 34:9). Even the day Joshua leads Israel across the Jordan corresponds to the same day Moses led Israel out of Egypt (Joshua 4:19). But Joshua didn’t simply do what Moses did; he went where Moses couldn’t. Moses was forbidden to enter Canaan because of his disobedience, but Joshua is given permission to conquer it (Joshua 1:9). 

Up to this point Israel knew Joshua as Moses’ assistant and a gifted strategist. But it wasn’t clear that he should be the next man to lead God’s people. So God proves Joshua is his chosen servant when he parts the Jordan river for him, just like he parted the Red Sea for Moses (Joshua 3:7-8). 

Joshua tells the priests to carry the ark of the covenant into the river. As soon as their soles touch the water, it parts and Israel’s army walks across on dry land (Joshua 3:17). Israel stands in awe. Joshua is clearly God’s chosen successor (Joshua 4:14). 

Joshua then commands Israel’s 12 tribal leaders to each gather a stone from the middle of the Jordan and build a memorial to God’s power (Joshua 4:7). Future generations are supposed to look at the stones and remember this new Exodus story (Joshua 4:22). But the stones are also a sign to all nations around Israel that God is with his people and should be feared (Joshua 4:24).

Where is the Gospel?

All these connections between Moses and Joshua are important because they are also connections to Jesus. 

It’s lost in our English Bible but Jesus’ Hebrew name is Joshua. Jesus is literally a new Joshua who brings us into his Promised Land and establishes the Kingdom of God by his death. And just as Joshua obeyed God and walked into the Jordan river, Jesus walked into the Jordan as a sign of obedience as well (Matthew 3:15). 

But instead of the river parting, the sky breaks open (Mark 1:10). And the Holy Spirit rests on Jesus like a dove, the way the spirit of wisdom filled Joshua. God then recognizes Jesus not only as a chosen servant but as his chosen Son (Matthew 3:17). 

Like Israel, we are on the edge of a kingdom and looking for a new leader. Just as Israel stood in awe of Joshua when the Jordan parted, we are to stand in awe of Jesus when we read how God parted the skies. 

Israel had a long history of slavery, wandering, and exile. But God used leaders like Moses and Joshua to liberate them and give them a home.

We are just as enslaved and wandering as Israel was. We are enslaved to sin and death. We find ourselves in countries, cultures, and families that don’t feel like home. The day we stand in awe of Jesus as God’s chosen Son is the day we enter into a new Kingdom. It is a Kingdom not marked by the abuse and slavery of our past but marked by the sky-rending power of God’s voice and the death-defeating hope in God’s Son. 

Jesus is our new Joshua and he is ready to lead us into his Kingdom. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who liberates and establishes kingdoms. And may you see Jesus as the chosen Son who leads us into our freedom."

The world as Judah knows it will soon be destroyed by God’s burning anger against the pride, violence, and idolatry of her leaders. The only one's sheltered on that day are the humble (Zephaniah 2:3). In chapters two and three, Zephaniah offers multiple prophecies explaining that God’s purifying fire will desolate those currently in power and leave behind a world without pride and evil for the humble to inherit. 

The economic centers of the rival nation Philistia will crash and their trading routes will fall (Zephaniah 2:4-5). The aftermath of God's purifying fire will turn Philistine civilization into pastureland (Zephaniah 2:6). And the people of Judah will live as humble shepherds in the ruins of a once proud economic superpower (Zephaniah 2:7). 

The nations Moab and Ammon have been arrogant, insulting, and threatening to Judah (Zephaniah 2:8, 10). Confident in their own gods, they see Israel’s God as weak. But the God of Israel will destroy the gods of Moab and Ammon (Zephaniah 2:11). The lands those deities protect, God will turn into pits of sulfur and salt (Zephaniah 2:9a). But the humble survivors who trust God will plunder what isn’t burned (Zephaniah 2:9b).

Assyria boasts that her capital, Nineveh, is unique among the world (Zephaniah 2:15a). But all the cultural accomplishments and pleasures of that city will dry up in the desert heat (Zephaniah 2:13). And where a once-indulgent culture ran wild, simple animals will make their homes (Zephaniah 2:14).

Zephaniah says God hoped his anger at the world that Judah so closely copied would lead her to turn away from her pride, violence, and idolatry (Zephaniah 3:6-7). He hoped his purifying fire would cause Judah to become a kingdom for all the humble of the world to flock to. But since it hasn’t, God tells proud Judah to wait for her inevitable destruction (Zephaniah 3:8).

As God’s people they carried a special calling to image God’s moral purity, love, and generosity to a watching world (Zephaniah 3:5). Instead, they have watched the world and imaged the oppression, rebellion, and impurity of it (Zephaniah 3:1). Disobedient, Judah’s rulers are lions and wolves, her prophets are treacherous, and her priests are profane (Zephaniah 3:2-4). Judah will be the last and least nation God will purify.

Where is the Gospel?

The purpose of God’s fire is not annihilation but purity. God’s fire humiliates the proud but raises the humble. God hoped that when Judah saw God’s fire among the nations, it would cause her to turn from her pride and become a kingdom where the humble would flock. God hopes the same for us through Jesus. 

Like Judah, Jesus carried a special calling to image God's moral purity, love, and generosity to a watching world (Hebrews 1:3). And he did so perfectly! He was God’s image in the flesh. But Jesus also experienced God’s burning anger against Judah’s pride. The apostle Paul even says Jesus became sin for his people (2 Corinthians 5:21). Just as the failings of Judah’s leaders brought God’s fire on themselves and the world, Jesus invited God’s purifying fire on himself in the world’s place. And like Zephaniah hoped, on the other side of God’s fire, the humble and the poor inherit God’s Kingdom on the earth (Matthew 5:3, 5).

In Judah's time, God's purifying fire left behind a world for humble shepherds, wounded survivors, and wild animals to inherit. And in Jesus, it’s humble shepherds who first meet King Jesus holding court among simple animals (Luke 2:8-20). And it’s to the poor and oppressed that Jesus first preached his good news (Luke 4:18-19). Jesus’ life and death tell us that God’s purifying fire has ended an era of evil and pride—and the humble can finally inherit the earth. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who purifies the world like fire. And may you see Jesus as the one that was judged so that the humble could inherit the world. "

Joshua uses some of his last words to remind Israel of God’s faithfulness (Joshua 24:3). He also warns them not to undermine what God has done by marrying idol-worshippers and joining in their cultural and religious practices (Joshua 23:7). 

God had devoted Canaan to destruction because of their sexual immorality and ritual child-sacrifice (Leviticus 18:3, Deuteronomy 12:31). If Israel now chooses to tolerate those practices and doesn't destroy those who commit them, Israel can expect the same type of destruction (Joshua 23:13). Israel has peace in their new homeland but it is dependent on their spiritual and moral purity (Joshua 23:16).

Joshua then encourages Israel by reminding them that the land they stand on was promised to Abraham (Joshua 24:2). He recounts how God destroyed every obstacle that threatened his promise. The land they now own, the cities they live in, and the fields they harvest are all evidence that God has kept his promise (Joshua 24:8). 

The people respond by pledging to serve God alone and refusing to worship other gods (Joshua 24:16). But Joshua tells them that they will fail. Joshua predicts that God’s jealousy for Israel’s devotion will never be matched by their devotion to him (Joshua 24:19). Israel insists they will be faithful, so Joshua builds a monument (Joshua 24:26). It’s supposed to remind Israel of their covenant and be a witness against them if they fail (Joshua 24:17).

Where is the Gospel?

Before Jesus died he summoned his 12 disciples the way Joshua summoned the 12 tribes of Israel. Jesus comforts his disciples and explains that he would rather die than leave them without an eternal homeland (John 15:3-4). But unlike Joshua, he doesn’t predict the disciples’ unfaithfulness, inability to obey, and idolatry. Instead, Jesus promises to send them the Holy Spirit who will cause them to remember and obey everything Jesus commanded (John 14:26)

Jesus predicts his people will finally listen, obey, and love their God fully. God was always for his people’s hearts. And God’s love for his people does not end with giving us a homeland, but rests when God makes his homeland in us (John 14:23). He fills us with the love for God that Israel lacked in Canaan, and a peace beyond what Israel experienced within its borders (John 14:27).

God did everything to secure a home for Israel, even though they could disqualify themselves from occupying it. But Jesus secures even more. He promises us a Kingdom that cannot be taken away from us—and a heart filled with his Spirit. When he fills us with his Spirit, he makes us his people in his land forever. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who does everything to keep his promises. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives us the Holy Spirit to keep his covenant."

The book of Joshua is about getting back to the Garden of Eden. But the promised land is no longer perfect, it’s full of enemies. And in the wake of Moses’ death, it is Joshua’s job to lead God’s people back into God’s good land and restore it.

Joshua served as Moses’ close assistant in the wilderness. He was on Mt. Sinai with Moses and saw God’s presence (Exodus 24:13). Back in the book of Numbers, Israel refused to trust God when he said they were to take the promised land (Numbers 13:31). They were too afraid. Israel’s timidity and faithlessness meant they wandered outside of their promised land for 40 years (Numbers 14:44). 

But Joshua always believed God would give them the land, even if it seemed impossible (Numbers 14:8). After 40 years, God tells Joshua he is finally giving the land of Cannan to Israel as a gift (Joshua 1:2). All of Israel’s enemies will be defeated because God will be with them (Joshua 1:5). But this new generation of Israel needs to be courageous in a way the previous generation was not (Joshua 1:8).

God tells Joshua and Israel three times that he is “with them.” He commands them four times to be “strong and courageous” (Joshua 1:6-7, 9, 18). 

After receiving God’s marching orders Joshua turns and speaks to his officers and tells them they have three days to prepare before they take possession of the land (Joshua 1:10-11). The officers unanimously accept Joshua as Moses’ successor and prepare to take the promised land (Joshua 1:16). 

Where is the Gospel?

If we want to see God’s Kingdom come, enter God’s promised land of peace, and experience a restoration of Eden, we need to be strong and courageous. But being strong and courageous isn’t about how many battles we’ve fought and won; it’s about trusting that God is with us and then acting like it’s true. That’s how God instructs Israel to turn the land of Canaan into his Kingdom. 

And that’s also how Jesus tells us his Kingdom advances on the earth. When Jesus sends out his disciples to baptize and teach all the nations of the world to obey him, he reminds them that he is with them always, even to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:20).

It’s God’s presence—not our power, persuasiveness, or politics—that will see God's Kingdom come. In fact, many of the battles Joshua will fight barely require him to lift his sword. God is not looking for warriors or spiritually elite persons. He’s looking for people who give their cowardice to him. He wants people who run towards the battle line because they know God is with them. 

When we courageously trust that Jesus is Emmanuel—God with us—Jesus brings his Kingdom, the final Garden of Eden, that much closer.

So if you feel embattled, scared about what the day might bring, or want to run from the conflict rather than towards it, be strong and courageous. God is with you. He comes not as a military power, but as a person who bravely battled the grave and won (1 Corinthians 15:24-26). He has even placed his death-defying Spirit inside you. God is with you more intimately than he ever was with Joshua. Jesus says his Spirit in us is better than standing right beside us (John 16:7). 

So be strong and courageous in Jesus! If God is for you, who can be against you (Romans 8:31)? 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is with us. And may you see Jesus as the one who sends his Holy Spirit to be with us always."

Joshua is about to lead Israel back into her ancestral homeland. But Jericho, a walled enemy city, stands in their way. Joshua sends two spies to scout for potential weaknesses (Joshua 2:1). But they’re immediately compromised and need to hide from the king’s guards in Rahab’s tavern (Joshua 2:2-3). Rahab is a prostitute. But she’s sympathetic to Israel because she’s heard the stories of how God destroyed the kings Sihon and Og (Joshua 2:10). The whole city lives in fear of Israel and her God (Joshua 2:11).

But while the kings of Canaan are preparing for war, Rahab is ready to worship. In an act of faith, she hides the spies, lies to protect them, and helps them escape (Joshua 2:4-6). She pledges allegiance to Israel's God. In exchange for helping the spies she asks for her family to be spared when Israel attacks Jericho (Joshua 2:12-13).

The spies agree and set up a code. Rahab needs to hang a scarlet thread out her window so the soldiers will know to spare her house (Joshua 2:18).

And when Joshua hears about Rahab’s faith and kindness, along with the spies' report that the hearts of Canaan’s warriors are melting from fear, he knows the Lord is about to give Israel its first victory in their promised land (Joshua 2:24).

Where is the Gospel?

It’s significant that the first story in a book about Israel’s conquest of Canaan is the story of a Canaanite prostitute confessing faith in Israel’s God. Rahab’s faith not only saves her from Jericho’s fate but includes her in God’s chosen people. God promised Abraham that Israel would own the land of Canaan and bless the whole world (Genesis 12:3). Rahab is God’s promise to Abraham coming true.

In fact, Rahab is listed as a hero of faith along with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Hebrews 11:31). When this enemy prostitute Rahab trusts God, she becomes a founding mother of the nation of Israel. Rahab is even one of Jesus’s ancestors. Because of Rahab’s faith, she’s a branch in Jesus’ family tree (Matthew 1:5). 

This is good news. If a prostitute on the wrong side of God’s battle lines can become a member of God’s family, so can we. Jesus tells his disciples “whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother” (Matthew 12:50). By faith alone God’s promise to bless the world comes true. And by faith alone we become brothers and sisters, even fathers and mothers, to Jesus.

Like the Canaanites, this should cause our hearts to melt inside of us—not just in love but in fear too. Jesus is like an army that has ransacked death, just as Israel rampaged through the powerful kingdoms of Sihon and Og. There is no ally and there are no walls that can protect us from Jesus’ rule and reign. 

We have a choice. We can resist him like the king of Jericho. Or we can, like Rahab, bow before the God of heaven and earth and be adopted into his family (Galatians 4:4-5).

See For Yourself 

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who saves his enemies and Jesus who makes God’s enemies his family."

Joshua begins his final military campaigns and destroys all God’s enemies (Joshua 12:1). The kings of Canaan are alarmed at Israel’s quick advance and feel betrayed by Gibeon’s surrender (Joshua 10:2). They form a coalition and strike Gibeon’s capital in retaliation (Joshua 10:4-5). The Gibeonites ask Joshua for help and he immediately sends his entire army to their aid (Joshua 10:6-8). 

Israel marches through the night and initiates a surprise attack at daybreak (Joshua 10:9). But before attacking, Joshua asks God for the sun and moon to stand still, and for the darkness before dawn to continue until their enemies are defeated (Joshua 10:12). And God answers Joshua’s prayer. He confuses the coalition’s army, sends hailstones, and extends the cover of darkness until the battle is won (Joshua 10:10-11). The enemy kings are captured, humiliated, and executed (Joshua 10:24, 26). 

Joshua tells his men that this victory will not be their last, but they must remain strong and courageous (Joshua 10:25). Quickly, they destroy seven major cities and take control of strategic high ground in southern Cannan (Joshua 10:41). From this position Joshua is situated to take the rest of the land. But before they do, Joshua reminds Israel that all this victory is because God fights for them (Joshua 10:42). 

Meanwhile, the tribes in the north of Canaan prepare for battle (Joshua 11:19). God hardens their hearts and leads them to their quick destruction. Israel finally has rest from war (Joshua 11:23).

We’re told that Joshua “left nothing undone” that the Lord had commanded Moses (Joshua 11:15). Chapter 12 then lists every kingdom the Lord won for Israel under both Moses and Joshua’s leadership.

Where is the Gospel?

Four times we’re told that the Lord fights for Israel: once after darkness covers the battlefield and gives Joshua the advantage at Gibeon (Joshua 10:14). Again after the kings of the coalition are humiliated and destroyed (Joshua 10:25-26). And a third and fourth time when the cities in the south and north finally fall (Joshua 10:42, 11:6). And just as constant as the Lord’s intervention, Joshua is faithful to pray, converse with God, and praise Him. When Joshua listens to God and obeys Him, he’s victorious. While Joshua’s victories are impressive and his answered prayer seems to break the laws of physics, Jesus accomplishes even more unprecedented miracles and victories. 

Like Joshua, Jesus listened to and obeyed God perfectly (John 5:19). All of Jesus’ prayers for miracles and healing are answered. And because of God’s love for his obedient son, God promises to reveal an even greater miracle than death to our enemies in battle—even greater than the sun standing still (John 5:20).

Jesus promises that everyone who listens to and obeys him will rise from the dead (John 5:24). More pressing than the Canaanites, death is our true enemy—and  that foe is defeated at the cross (1 Corinthians 15:26). On the cross, our battles with death and our enemies are finished (John 19:30). By Jesus giving up his spirit, we finally rest. Like Joshua, Jesus left nothing undone in his battle against death. He has secured rest from any enemy that dares stand against us. He gives us a home in his land forever.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who fights for you. And may you see Jesus as our obedient warrior who destroys our enemies and gives us a home."

Jacob has received the blessing from his father Isaac and is instructed to flee to his family’s homeland for two reasons. First, his older brother Esau wants to kill him for stealing his blessing. Second, to find a wife among their own people, which Esau did not do (28:8-9). 

As Jacob is journeying to his family’s homeland, he stops for the night. While sleeping, Jacob receives a dream from God that changes his life. 

He sees a large structure like a ladder, tower, or staircase, reaching up from earth to heaven (28:12). All along this ladder, he sees angels ascending and descending on it. Then God’s voice rings out as he speaks to Jacob. 

Even though he had received his father’s blessing, there was a far more important one he needed to receive - God’s. So God speaks the same covenant he made with Abraham and Isaac, now, to Jacob. God will make Jacob’s descendants a great nation and will give them the land promised to Abraham (28:14a).

But why the ladder? It is the opposite of the Tower of Babel. At that tower, humans tried to build a structure that would reach up to heaven and allow them access to God (11:4). They were trying to build a gate to heaven. But God foiled their attempts by confusing their language and dispersing them among the nations. 

In contrast to Babel, this time God builds the tower. He doesn’t call humans to come up it, but he and his angels travel down it. God himself builds the gate to heaven. In fact, that’s what Jacob calls the place where he had this vision: “the gate of heaven” (28:17). 

And by the end of the dream, people aren’t dispersed among the nations as at Babel (11:8). Instead, God promises to unite people under one new nation (28:14b).

Jacob’s ladder shows us how God will reverse the effects of man’s sin typified by the Tower of Babel. How would he do this? God would do what humans tried to do. At Babel, it was man’s effort. But with Jacob’s ladder, it was God’s. 

Where is the Gospel?

This dream is not fulfilled in Jacob’s life, but in Jesus’. 

Jesus references this story at the beginning of the Gospel of John. He says that angels will descend and ascend on him like they did on Jacob’s ladder (John 1:51). What does he mean by this? He means that he is the one that connects earth with heaven. How appropriate is it, then, that later in John’s Gospel Jesus calls himself the gate (John 10:9). Jesus opens up the way to God. 

Getting to God is not about building a big enough tower of good works and effort so that you can get to where he is. Getting to God starts with God getting to us. He comes down the ladder. He did this completely in Jesus (Phil 2:6-7). God left heaven to come to earth in order to give us access to himself. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will show you the God who descends and comes to us, and Jesus who built the ladder between heaven and earth with his own body and blood on the cross."

Noah and his family are still in the ark. The rains have been pounding the earth for 40 days. But now the time has come for the rains to stop, and for Noah and his family to leave the ark and come back to dry ground (8:13). 

After leaving the ark, God gives Noah’s family the same command he gave to Adam and Eve in the beginning - be fruitful and multiply (9:1).

Along with this command, God makes a covenant with Noah and his descendants. He promises to never again wipe out all humanity with a flood (9:11). 

God seals this promise with a sign, a rainbow (9:13). 

The bow in the sky was meant to be seen as a warrior’s bow. But if the arch of a rainbow formed the arch of a bow, the arrow would fly right into heaven. That is the point God is making. A time will come when punishment won’t come down on the earth but will fall upon God himself in a supreme act of mercy. 

Then right after God gives this promise, we see something similar. As there was a division between Adam’s children after the garden of Eden, there is a division between Noah’s children after the flood. Ham is cursed because he sees his father’s nakedness (9:22). 

Exactly what happened is hard to tell. It at least involved Ham seeing his father naked and spreading his father’s shame outside his tent by telling his brothers. At most, it could be a euphemism for a sexual act of incest. Whatever the reason, for his actions, a curse comes upon Ham (9:25). By contrast, a blessing is given to one of his brothers, Shem (9:26). 

Which means the remnant God has promised to save would come through Shem. 

This blessing proves to have been sovereignly placed. 

Where is the Gospel? 

In the Gospel of Luke, in the New Testament, we read the genealogy of Jesus. And whose name do we see? Shem, the son of Noah (3:36). Jesus is the one who fulfills the blessing Noah gave to his sons.

Jesus completes the mission given to Noah and his family after the flood. They were supposed to fill the earth with the image of God. But sin continued to spread. However, when Jesus saves an individual he makes them into his image (2 Cor 3:18). Through his Christians and his Church, Jesus is covering the world with God’s image.

Jesus is also the fulfillment of the promise made with the rainbow. On the cross, the punishment we deserved fell upon Jesus (Is. 53:5). The bow turned toward heaven. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see God as one who has always been making a way to keep a remnant of undeserving people for himself. And that you would see Jesus as the one who makes the saving of undeserving people possible by turning our punishment into a promise on the cross."

God brings good out of evil. He proves this in the story of Joseph. 

After being sold into slavery, Joseph also becomes wrongly imprisoned for resisting the sexual advances of his master’s wife (39:20). While in jail, God makes sure Joseph’s endeavors succeed so that he becomes a prison warden. While serving in this position, Joseph interprets two dreams that both come true (40:21-22). So when Pharaoh has a dream himself Joseph is called upon, and accurately interprets his dream as well. 

The dream is a warning that God is about to bring seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine in Egypt (41:25). 

For Joseph’s insight, Pharaoh appoints him to second in command. The famine comes just as Joseph said it would. But since they were prepared, Joseph was able to provide stored up grain to all the nations that came to them for help. 

This story allows us to both compare and contrast what God does through Joseph with the rest of Israel’s story. 

Joseph’s brothers tried to make him a slave, but God made him a king. Judah gave into sexual temptation with Tamar, but Joseph resisted it. Whereas so much of the sin surrounding this story points to God’s grace in the midst of evil, Joseph’s goodness points to the fact that God can raise up a righteous person out of the worst situations. 

Under Joseph’s care, the food in Egypt was fruitful and multiplied, as God promised Abraham his children would be. The text even says that the “world” came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph (41:57). So here we get a foretaste of all the nations of the earth being blessed through Abraham’s descendants. 

But the people aren’t fruitful, just the food. And the nations aren’t being blessed with God’s presence, just with grain. It is an incomplete fulfillment. 

Where is the Gospel? 

That is why we must see Jesus in this story as well. 

Joseph may have been righteous by comparison, but Jesus is the only one who is perfectly righteous. Jesus is the one who not only resisted sexual temptation from one woman but was tempted in every way and never sinned (Hebrews 4:15). 

Unlike Joseph, Jesus willingly came to earth to make himself a slave to all, even to the point of death (Philippians 2:7-8). He did not just descend into a prison, but into the jail that imprisons all humanity - the grave itself (1 Pt 3:19). Yet, God used Jesus’ death to bring him to the throne above every throne (Phil 2:9). 

The story of Joseph shows us a partial, incomplete, fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham. Jesus, however, brings complete fulfillment. Jesus multiplies his spiritual blessings to us. He is the bread of life that feeds us in the direst seasons of life’s famines (Jn 6:35). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit shows you the God who brings good out of the worst evil and that you would see that Jesus underwent the worst of our evil to bring the whole world the greatest good. "

Joseph is now a ruler in Egypt. From being sold as a slave, God has raised him up to hold one of the most powerful seats in the entire ancient world. 

But as Joseph saw in the dream, the land was going through seven years of famine. This included Canaan, where Joseph’s family lived. So Joseph’s brothers travel to Egypt to buy food, leaving only the youngest, Benjamin, behind (42:3). 

Upon arriving in Egypt, Joseph recognizes his brothers, but they don’t recognize him (42:7). So Joseph plays a series of tricks on them. He calls them spies and sends them away, demanding they bring Benjamin back. Yet, Joseph secretly returns the money they used to buy the grain. 

The brothers return with Benjamin, but this time Joseph sneaks his silver cup into the youngest brother's bag (44:2). When caught, Benjamin is threatened with imprisonment. But Judah intercedes, begging Joseph to let him take his place. 

Joseph can’t take the rouse any longer. He clears his court and reveals his true identity (45:1). 

He tells his brothers that it was not them that sent him to Egypt, but God. And God did this to save many lives, that there might be a remnant left on the earth after this massive famine (45:7). Like Noah and the flood, God raised up one man to save a remnant of people on the earth. 

God worked through the brothers' evil trickery to bring Joseph to the place where he could save the world. 

But God also used Joseph’s more innocent tricks to change the brothers as well. The brothers go through a moral change in this process. Going from selling their brother into slavery, to being willing to sell themselves into slavery for their brother. 

Where is the Gospel?

The most important picture of Jesus we need to see in this text is of God using one righteous man, sold into slavery, in order to save the world (Rom 5:17). We are the brothers, who sentence Jesus to death with our sin. But he treats us like Joseph treated his brothers (Ps 103:10). 

He provides us with food that saves our lives, but doesn’t even charge us for it (Is 55:1). Even though we killed him, he forgives us, fills our bags with provision, and welcomes us into his courts. 

When things look like they are too hopeless, or the famine is too severe, we can trust that God is working out his plans to save the world through it all. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who is in control of all things and uses that control to shape us, provide for us, and accomplish his plans. And that you would see Jesus as both the king who provides and the brother who lays down his life."

The end of Genesis gets us ready for the beginning of Exodus. 

God told Abraham back in chapter 15 that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land for 400 years (15:13). Now that time is coming. It’s no wonder, then, that when God appeared to Jacob on his way to Egypt, God told him not to be afraid to go (46:3). And the reason he didn’t need to be afraid was that God would bring them back out of Egypt. 

This is the promise repeated constantly throughout these last chapters of Genesis. Jacob makes Joseph promise him to bury his body back in Canaan as a testament to the fact that his descendants won’t stay in Egypt (49:29). 

Before dying, however, Jacob extends a long series of blessings to his 12 sons. This is the high point of all the blessings and curses pronounced through the fall, Cain, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now God’s promise is passing from one individual, Jacob, to a nation - Israel. 

But above all the blessings given, history recounted, and promises made in these closing chapters, one truth stands out above all the rest. 

After all his brothers did, Joseph is not mad (50:18). He forgives them because he knows something true about how God works. 

Here is what he says: “You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good” (50:20a). 

You intended harm. God intended good. 

This is a theme all throughout Genesis. God takes the sinfulness, deceit, trickery, lust, depravity, and selfishness of humans, and makes good out of them. From Adam and Eve’s fall, to Jacob tricking Isaac, to Judah sleeping with his daughter-in-law, God has been bringing good out of evil the whole way. And he does it to accomplish a purpose - the saving of many lives (50:20b). 

Where is the Gospel?

How can we not see the Gospel in this? 

People sought to harm Jesus by imprisoning him, forcing him through an illegitimate trial, whipping him though he was innocent, and murdering him on a cross. 

They intended harm. God intended good. 

Through harming Jesus in this way, God has accomplished his ultimate purpose - the saving of many lives (Acts 2:23). 

Jesus is the promised seed of Adam and Eve that crushes the head of the serpent. 

Jesus is the descendant of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob who blesses all nations. 

Jesus is the one who will bring us out of this current Egypt we are in, and take us to the promised land of his presence forever. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who always keeps his promises and even through the evil intentions of human hearts. And that you see Jesus all throughout Genesis as the promise keeper who takes every evil intention and brings about God’s ultimate good."

Three mysterious men come to visit Abraham. After repeating God’s promise to Abraham and enjoying a meal, two of the men go into Sodom and Gomorrah while one stays with Abraham (19:1). The two who go into town are angels, but the third man is identified as the LORD (18:22). 

The LORD tells Abraham that he is about to completely destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because of their terrible evil. But Abraham can’t believe that the city is really 100% evil. So he comes to God and says that he would not be a just judge if he punished the good along with the bad (18:23). So God agreed that if there were just 10 righteous people in the cities, they both would be completely spared from judgement. 

But, it turns out, the city cannot produce even ten good people. In fact, the people are so evil, they try to recreate the horrific practices that brought about the Nephilim in Genesis 6. The citizens try to sexually violate the angels visiting the city (19:5). 

God already knew it would turn out this way. So he destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as he said he would. 

What can we make of this story? What we need to understand is that every city is Sodom and Gomorrah. The whole world is 100% evil (Ps 14:3). The Bible tells us that no one is righteous and all are wicked. The flood already proved this. 

However, as with the flood and even with Sodom and Gomorrah, God always provides a way of escape. 

The way he provides an escape from his justice is hinted at by Abraham’s request. Abraham asked God to save the whole city if he found 10 righteous people (18:32). For the sake of those righteous people, the city would have been saved. The undeserving would have been saved by the merit of the deserving. But the righteous ones were not found. 

However, Lot and his children were saved because of Abraham’s righteousness (19:29). God was gracious to Lot because of Abraham.

Where is the Gospel? 

The Gospel jumps off the pages of this story. Jesus is the perfect righteous one. When we hide in him by faith, God saves us because of the righteousness of his son (2 Cor 5:21). Though the whole world is wicked, those who believe in him are saved on account of his goodness. 

This truth is stated clearly by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. Jesus says that what happened at Sodom and Gomorrah would be preferable to what will happen to everyone who does not believe his message (Mat 10:15).

But Jesus is incalculably gracious. For simply by believing in him, we are hidden in his goodness and escape the punishment we deserve. 

We are Sodom and Gomorrah, he is the righteous one. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will show you the God who always provides a way of escape for those who trust him, and that you would see Jesus as the way of escape graciously provided to all who believe."

Jacob has met with God in a dream with the ladder and now he arrives at his grandfather Abraham’s hometown to find a wife. 

Like his father who went before him, Jacob finds the woman he wants to marry at a well (29:9). Her name is Rachel. Jacob agrees to work for Rachel’s father, Laban, 7 years in exchange for her hand in marriage (29:18). 

Thus begins a series of tricks and deceit between Jacob and Laban. Laban deceives Jacob into accidentally marrying Rachel’s older sister, Leah. Jacob must work 7 more years to be allowed to marry Rachel as well. 

This creates a rivalry between Leah and Rachel that results in them each trying to have children with Jacob (30:1). And it’s through this outrageous rivalry, Jacob has 12 sons, which God would turn into the 12 tribes of Israel. 

But the trickery continues over livestock. Through a series of tricks between both Laban and Jacob, Jacob ends up with the bigger and healthier flock (30:43). But it is not Jacob’s tactics that made him rich, it was God (32:10). 

Finally, Jacob and his family leave and make their way back to the land where God met him in the dream. 

What are we to make of all this trickery and deceit? Why would the fathers of the 12 tribes of Israel come about through such morally dicey means? It is to show us something incredibly important about who God is and how he works. God keeps his promises. That’s who he is. 

He promised that Abraham’s family would become a great nation, and here we have the beginnings of it. No matter what happens in the world or how messed up we make it, God will accomplish his plans. God repurposes evil intentions and shows mercy to people who don’t deserve it (50:19). . 

Where is the Gospel? 

This is fully seen in the cross of Jesus. 

For there has never been a more dastardly trick played than the betrayal, arrest, false trail, and innocent murder of Jesus (Mark 14:56). But through these horrid acts, God accomplished everything he promised to Jacob. 

The cross shows us that no matter how wicked and dark things get, God brings about his good intentions. If he can bring the world’s greatest good out of the corrupt murder of his innocent son, he can bring good out of anything (2 Cor. 4:14). 

Moreover, the grandest and best trick ever played was the gospel event itself. Paul explains in 2 Corinthians 2:8 that if people knew who Jesus was they would not have crucified him. Furthermore, if the evil spiritual forces knew what would happen by killing this man Jesus, they wouldn’t have gone through with it either. The trick of the gospel is the greatest reversal of all time. Evil thought it would beat Jesus by killing him, but it ended up being their own defeat. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would help you see the God who can work through anything to accomplish his plan, and that you would see Jesus as the one who subverts and conquers sin by his cross by performing the ultimate trick against death itself by rising from the dead. "

This is the first mention of the Gospel in the Bible.",Website,Genesis Bible Study,"What's Happening?

What is sin? That’s a big question. And we get our first glimpse of it here in Genesis 3. 

Adam and Eve have been made in God’s image, given the garden to enjoy, and are simply to tend it, have children, and cover the earth with God’s image and presence (2:15). That’s all the knowledge of right and wrong, good and evil, they needed to thrive. 

In fact, they are only given one negative command. They are not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (2:16). But why? 

The tree offers a knowledge not provided by God. To stay away from it would be to say, “God is enough. He has provided everything I need.” To eat from it, on the other hand, would be to say, “God is not enough. I need to provide something better for myself.” 

Satan, a spiritual being who looks like a snake in this story, tempts Eve to take the second option (3:1). He tells her that if she eats from this tree, she will know everything God knows. In fact, she will be like God (3:5). 

This should have been a pointless temptation. After all, Eve was already made in God’s image and had been told everything she needed to know from God himself. 

But she wanted more. She wanted to provide for herself. That’s what sin is - trying to get the good apart from God. 

Ironically, as soon as both Eve and Adam ate this fruit, they did gain a new bit of knowledge. But it was only the knowledge that they were sinners. They felt ashamed, naked, and afraid of God (3:7). 

So they have a conversation with God after trying to hide from him (3:8). But ultimately man and woman receive a curse from God. They will be kicked out of the garden and will die (3:24). 

But along with the curse, also comes a promise. God promises that Eve will have a child that will crush the head of the snake, breaking the curse of death and separation (3:15). 

Where is the Gospel?

It is truly amazing that only three chapters into the Bible, we already have an explicit promise of God’s plan to save the world through what we now know as the Gospel.

That is because the promised child of Eve is none other than Jesus. He is the one who crushed Satan’s head by taking the curse of sin off of us and onto himself. Furthermore, Jesus overcame the death earned in the garden by rising from the grave. 

Jesus not only reversed the curse earned by sin, he also gives us a way to conquer sin in our lives. Unlike Eve, we fight sin by trusting that Jesus is enough. He has done enough, provided enough, and will always be enough. You can stop trying to earn it. Satan’s head is already crushed. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who provides so richly for us that he doesn’t want us even going near the destructive lies of self-salvation and sin. And I pray that you would see Jesus as the promised one who has crushed the head of the snake, defeating death and the curse."

Six chapters into the Bible, just a few chapters after God created mankind, he says that he is going to wipe humans off the face of the earth (6:7). What could have happened to get to this point? 

God’s purpose for the world was for his image to cover the earth, but now the opposite had happened. Man’s evil image had covered it instead (6:5). In fact, not only was the image of fallen man covering the earth, in the story of the Nephilim we find that the image of rebel spiritual beings were spreading as well (6:2). 

God would not allow his good creation to self-destruct. Neither would he let all this wickedness continue to run rampant and unpunished. God had a purpose for creation and it would not be thwarted. 

So God would carry out his punishment through a flood (6:17). But back in chapter 3, God promised that death and sin would not win, that the curse would not get victory. He promised that one child from Eve’s line would not fall under the curse, but would actually defeat it (3:15). 

And we see that this promise is still being worked out when Noah finds favor in God’s eyes (6:9). Noah was the only righteous person on the planet. Now, we know that humanity didn’t just happen to luck out that there was one good guy left. God provided the one good guy. He created Noah, he made him good and did so in order to provide someone to keep his promise alive. 

So, God puts Noah into a large boat so that he, his family, and creation may be saved (7:1). It is important to notice that God saved Noah’s family because of Noah’s righteousness, not their own. Others were saved because of Noah’s righteousness.

Now, the reality is, the world continued to be in this dire situation. The Bible teaches us that no one is righteous (Rom 3:10). No one could find favor in God’s eyes by their own goodness. Everyone in the world deserves to be covered once again with God’s punishment (Rom. 3:23). 

Where is the Gospel? 

But, as he did with Noah, God provided one man from the line of Eve to save the world. And this one man found favor in God’s eyes because he was God himself. This one man was not only righteous but was righteousness itself (1 Cor. 1:30). This one man is Jesus. 

But unlike Noah, God did not judge the earth and save one man. Instead, he judged one man, Jesus, so that he could save the earth. Now, anyone who puts their faith in Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection can enter into his righteousness and be safe from punishment like Noah and his family entered into the ark and were safe from the flood (1 Pt 3:20-21). 

This is also the way God will ultimately save all creation. He will renew the world, and cover the earth with his goodness. And this final covering won’t be with the waters of punishment, but with the waters of his presence (Hab 2:14). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will show you a God, grieved by sin, who goes to great lengths to save those who hate him. And that you would be given eyes to see Jesus as the one who falls under the flood of God’s judgement for us so that we can be saved."

God is in control. God is faithful. These two truths jump off the page in all three stories in this passage. 

In the first story, Abram and his nephew Lot are in a predicament. Their large herds of livestock cannot live in the same area (13:5-6). So Abram gives up his right to choose and lets Lot pick. Without Abram even picking, God secures for him the land he promised. 

In the second story, Lot’s land is attacked by an allied group of several rival kingdoms and as a result, his family and goods are plundered (14:12). But Abram, with just 318 men, manages to drive out the attackers and rescue Lot, his family, and all of his possessions (14:15). How was Abram able to do this? We learn that it was God who gave him the victory. 

In the final story, Abram is blessed by a man named Melchizedek who is both a king and a priest (14:19). In response, Abram gives a tenth of everything he had to Melchizedek (14:20b). Interrupting this scene, the king of Sodom tries to bless Abram by giving him the plunder from the battle (14:21). 

Abram refuses saying he does not want to give anyone the ability to say, “I made Abram rich.”(14:23) But even though Abram refused physical goods, gave a tenth of what he did have, God still blessed him. 

God is in control. God is faithful. 

Where is the Gospel?

God’s control and faithfulness reach their heights in Jesus. 

Abram seemingly had no choice in which piece of land he would inherit. His land was selected by the process of elimination. Yet, this was a blessing to him. It was where God wanted him to be. 

This is good news to those of us who know Jesus. No matter where we, either by choice or by what seems to be happenstance, we are not too far from God’s reach. All along, he is setting our steps to come to bring us to the place he wants us to be (Prob 16:9). 

Like Abram’s small army, Jesus beat the biggest enemy of sin and death through the weakest of all tactics, laying his life down on a cross. That is because even the weakness of God is stronger than the strength of men (1 Cor. 1:23, 25). 

Lastly, the story of Melchizedek is also about Jesus. Melchizedek had no recorded genealogy or no death. It’s almost as if he was symbolically eternal (Heb 7:3). But what Melchizedek resembled, Jesus actually is - an eternal priest (Heb 7:17). 

And like Abram, we cannot be bought for all the riches of this world. For the plunder Jesus earned for us in his death and resurrection is a greater treasure than anything found on earth (Rom 8:17). 

See for Yourself 

May the Holy Spirit show you the God who is in control of all circumstances and brings everything together to be faithful to his promises. And may you see Jesus the king who died in order to be our priest forever."

If there is one thing that will help us understand Genesis, it’s the promise God made about the two seeds in Genesis 3:15. God promised that two lines of children would come from Adam and Eve. One would carry the promise and blessing of God - this would be the line of Eve. The other would carry the curse and punishment of God - this would be the line of the serpent (3:15). 

Right away, Adam and Eve have two kids: Cain and Abel (4:1-2a). Abel is faithful and his offerings are accepted by God. Cain, on the other hand, is wicked and his offerings are not accepted. So, in jealousy and anger, Cain murders his brother Abel (4:8). Here we have the two seeds: one holy and one wicked. But this time, in the first physical death recorded in the Bible, the seed of the serpent crushes the seed of Eve. It seems like God’s promise is going in reverse. 

To make things worse, Cain moves away and establishes his own family line (4:16). When he does this, it’s not only his kids that start multiplying but their evil. Eventually, one of Cain’s descendants named Lamech also commits murder and says that God’s curse has increased upon him ten times over (4:24). Things seem to just keep getting worse under the curse. 

That’s when we see that there is hope. Adam and Eve have another child now that Abel is dead. His name is Seth (4:25). And when Seth comes into the world, people begin to follow God (4:26). The line of Eve and God’s promise are still intact. That’s when we read about Seth’s line multiplying and growing. And instead of evil increasing, God’s goodness does. This goodness leads to increased intimacy with God. One of Seth’s descendants, Enoch, walked with God so closely that he didn’t die, but God just took him away (5:24). 

What we need to see here is that nothing can stop God’s promises. Not even when everything seems like it's moving in the worst possible direction. God always brings good out of evil and always keeps his promises. 

Where is the Gospel?

We see this most fully in Jesus. The New Testament tells us that Jesus’ blood speaks a better word than Abel’s (Heb 12:24). Abel’s blood cried out from the ground against Cain, condemning him and accusing him. Jesus’ blood, when sprinkled on us, cries out on our behalf advocating for us and interceding for us. Jesus’ blood speaks a blessing over us instead of a curse. 

Jesus also reverses the effects of evil found in this story. Evil increased among Cain’s descendants, but God’s blessing increases and covers the whole earth in Jesus (Hab 2:14). That is because he is the promised seed of Eve, the final descendant of Adam and Abel, the new and better Seth, who not only walks with God like Enoch but is God himself. Jesus, the promised one, puts an end to the curse of death for us and gives us the promised blessing of life with God. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who provides a way of blessing even when everything looks cursed and that you would see Jesus as the one who came from the line of Eve to bring a blessing to the whole earth."

God has sworn that he would make Abram’s descendants so numerous that they could not be counted, they would be a great nation and would be a blessing to the whole world (15:5).

The only problem is, Abram is very old, has no children and his wife is barren (11:30). God knew Abram was doubting his promises, so he visits Abram in a vision where he doubles down on his promise (15:1-2a).

God enters into a traditional covenant ceremony with Abram. In this ceremony, animals would be sacrificed and cut in two (15:10). Then, the people making the covenant would walk in between the halves of each animal as a physical symbol which communicated, “If I break this promise, let what was done to these animals be done to me.” 

But, here, God alone passes through the animals. By doing so, he was saying that he alone would keep the promise and if he didn’t he would bear the punishment (15:17). 

But Abram and his wife’s doubts endure. So they decide to try and create this countless nation by having a child with their servant, Hagar (16:2). She immediately gets pregnant, so Sarai sends her away in a jealous rage (16:6b). 

But God appears to Hagar, tells her to return, and promises to establish a people through her child as well (16:10). However, this child does not receive the blessing that Abram wanted. Hagar’s child would not be the child of promise, but would remain the child of a slave. That is because Abram tried to earn through effort what God had promised through grace. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Both of these stories have so much to show us about who Jesus is and what he has done. 

Just as God promised to uphold the covenant alone, by passing through the animals by himself, Jesus keeps his own promise for us. Despite all our faults and sin, Jesus has done and will do everything to save us from what we deserve and bring us to himself (2 Cor. 1:20). All we are called to do is what Abram did - receive the promises of God with faith. 

Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross is an intensified version of what Abram experienced in this cultural ritual. The cross communicates that even though we broke the covenant, God has been torn apart for us (1 Pt 2:24). Therefore, no punishment remains for those who believe in Jesus. Instead, all that remains is the promise.

The Apostle Paul, when writing to the Galatians, shows us that the division between Sarai and Hagar’s children still exists today (Gal 4:24). We are enslaved when we try to be a part of God’s family and bring about God’s promises through our own strength and effort (Gal 4:23). 

We only become children of the promise when we trust the promise. If we simply have faith that Jesus has done for us what we could not do for ourselves, we freely receive all the benefits of the promise from our father. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who upholds all the promises he makes by himself. And that you would see Jesus who has earned for us through the cross everything he promised to us in grace.

Jacob has escaped from Laban and his deceitfulness. But now Jacob must confront the first person he ever tricked - his brother Esau (32:6-7a). Last he heard, Esau was set on murdering him. How would this confrontation go? 

Jacob asks God to protect him from Esau (32:11), but also reverts back to his old tricky ways. Jacob decides to send a parade of gifts to Esau to win him over before they meet. 

But before his confrontation with Esau, Jacob sets up camp for the night. Without warning, an unnamed man starts to wrestle with him (32:24). 

Slowly it is revealed that this unnamed man wrestling with Jacob is actually God. Jacob had wrestled his whole life, and used tricks every time. But now, there are no tricks. He just holds on to God and won’t let go (32:26).  

Why is he holding onto God? Jacob is begging God to bless him before he lets him go. Jacob stole a blessing when his father’s sight was dark. But here, Jacob begs for a legitimate blessing in the light of day. 

God then blesses Jacob with the same blessing he gave to Abraham. Then, as God changed Abraham’s name, he changes Jacob’s name. It is here that God’s chosen people receive their name. God renames Jacob, Israel - which means, “He strives with God” (32:28).  

Israel will live up to that name. Just as Jacob had to go through a period of exile and wrestling with others, with sin, and with God, so his people, Israel, would do the same. 

From there, Jacob goes out to meet his brother Esau. He sends the parade of gifts ahead of him. But by the time Jacob gets to Esau, his brother simply embraces him (33:4). Esau didn’t need to be bought off because God had answered Jacob’s prayer for protection by changing his brother’s heart (33:8-9). 

Where is the Gospel? 

This beautiful story of planning, wrestling, and reconciliation is our story as well. 

We regularly formulate plans when we think about how we are going to approach God. We try to figure out what parade of good deeds, excuses, or justifications we can make for why God should forgive us. But, as this story shows us, we don’t need to approach God this way (Eph. 2:8-9). 

The reason we don’t have to approach God with a parade of good deeds is that Jesus has gone before us already (Rom 8:34). He was wounded by God and won a blessing for us (1 Pt 3:18). Even when we were faithless, scheming, tricksters, Jesus took the blow we deserved (2 Cor. 5:21). 

God has already accepted us because of Jesus. Even when we try to pay him off, He simply embraces us.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who contends with us in our sin and meets with us in the person of Jesus to take our wounds and reconcile us to himself. "

Jacob and his family are traveling back from their long stay with Laban. In one of the towns where he stopped, an appalling incident takes place. Jacob’s daughter Dinah is raped by the prince of the land (34:2). Dinah’s brothers were furious. Jacob was passive. 

The prince, Shechem, then begs to marry Dinah. In an act of revenge, Jacob’s sons fool him and all his people into getting circumcised (34:15). But this was not a genuine invitation into their people group or into a relationship with their God. Like Jacob before them, it was a trick. 

When all the men were recovering from their painful surgeries, two of the brothers, Simeon and Levi, kill every male in the city and reclaim their sister Dinah (34:25). The rest of Jacob’s sons, then plunder the dead, steal livestock, and capture the women and children. 

Even after all this bloodshed and violence, God miraculously provides safe passage for Jacob and his family to Bethel and meets with Jacob again (35:11). Surprisingly, the covenant with Jacob and his sons is not canceled, but re-confirmed. 

The story ends with the completion of Jacob’s family and an overview of Esau’s (36:1). The twelfth and final son is born to Jacob, but his wife dies in childbirth (35:18). The inclusion of Esau’s line shows us that God’s blessing really is for all nations. He can make great nations and bless people even when those who are supposed to be the carriers of that blessing fail. 

Where is the Gospel? 

He does this ultimately through Jesus who we defiled like Dinah, but unto death. And we actually deserved much worse than what Simeon and Levi did to the people of Shechem. However, Jesus did not stay passive like Jacob or avenge himself on the world like Jacob’s sons. 

Jesus became active. He bore the vengeance we deserved. Jesus is, therefore both Dinah the defiled, and Shechem the destroyed. He is both the offended party and the one who bears the penalty of the offense (Rom 3:26). 

This is such good news. For Jacob’s sons not only failed here but will fail again and again as the people of Israel. Nevertheless, God’s plan to bless the world is never thwarted by failures. For the final son of Jacob, Jesus has been faithful on behalf of the whole world. 

Because of the gospel, we who constantly fail over and over again can have the blessing of salvation re-confirmed to us, especially in the times when we know we deserve it the least (1 John 2:1). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who forgives even the worst of sins and upholds even the biggest promises. And that you would see Jesus as both the defiled one and the punished one, who allowed both to happen to him so he could extend an undeserved promise to us."

The flood is over. God has made his covenant with Noah. And Noah’s kids have been divided - Shem with a blessing, Ham with the curse. 

Now, we see the blessing and curse play out. Nearly every wicked nation we meet in the biblical story comes from Ham’s cursed line: Egypt, the Philistines, Nineveh, Babylon, Assyria, and a host of others (10:6). But, from Shem’s line comes someone who will be the father of God’s blessing to all nations - Abraham (11:26). 

As humanity starts to grow, some of Ham’s children, most likely a man named Nimrod (yep, Nimrod) settled in a place called Shinar, which is also known as Babylonia (11:2). 

They attempted to build a man-centered city that would make a name for themselves instead of God. The centerpiece of the city would be a colossal tower that reached into the heavens, showing that they didn’t even need God anymore (11:4). In fact, if they wanted God at all it would be their tower, their temple, that God would use to come down among them.

God noted that if they are one people with one language, nothing will be impossible for them (11:6). Meaning, the delusion of Eve’s sin in Eden will be complete. Mankind will have finally tricked themselves into thinking they really don’t need God - which only leads to death. 

So God comes down to the people, with no help from their incomplete tower, and confuses their languages, dispersing them into different nations (11:9). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The disunity and dispersion of this story are reversed in the New Testament. 

In Acts 2, on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came and unified languages so that people from different nations heard the Gospel in one tongue (Acts 2:6). And the message they heard was not about humanity trying to make a name for themselves, but about one name alone - the name of Jesus (Acts 2:23). 

It wasn’t a message about how humanity should be building their way to God, but how God came to humanity in the person of Jesus. So when they were filled with the Holy Spirit, there was no desire to build an independent temple up to the heavens, because God was building his collective temple across the earth in the people he was saving (2:44-45). 

And now, for the church of Jesus, nothing will be impossible for them. What was destructively true about the experiment with the tower in Babylonia, becomes constructively true about the church of Jesus. We can do all things through Christ, and the gates of hell will not prevail against us (Mat. 16:18). There is no condemnation for those in Jesus (Rom 8:1). The Gospel put into the hearts of people by the Holy Spirit, reverses what happened at the tower.

I pray that the Holy Spirit gives you eyes to see the God who refuses to leave us to our own devices and that you would see Jesus as the one who came down from heaven to do everything necessary to make our salvation possible. "

Jacob and his sons are living in Canaan. We learn that Joseph was his favorite. So much so that he gives him a multicolored coat of favor. Joseph then has dreams that intensify the fact that he is set apart from his brothers (37:5). His brothers are sick of it. 

They sell Joseph into slavery, but tell their father Jacob he was killed by a wild beast (37:28). 

The sin and dysfunction of Jacob's sons leave us wondering, “How this could possibly be God’s chosen people?” The story that follows is no different. 

One of Jacob’s other sons, Judah, wrongly marries a Canaanite woman and has three sons (38:2). But the first two are so wicked that God literally puts them to death (38:7). This leaves his firstborn’s wife, Tamar, widowed and without children of her own. Judah instructs Tamar to wait until his youngest son can grow up and marry her. But as Tamar faithfully waits, Judah wrongfully holds his youngest son back from her. Judah fails to do his part in continuing God’s blessed family line. 

So Tamar decides to take action. In order to continue the line of her father, she disguises herself as a cult prostitute, seduces her father-in-law and becomes pregnant (38:15). After Tamar’s pregnancy is exposed, she is nearly burned alive for her immorality. But when she reveals that Judah is the father, he says that she is more righteous than himself and lets her go. 

This is such a tangled web of sin that it leaves us wondering what good can come out of it. 

Where is the Gospel? 

We should be reminded of the horrors Jesus, the final son of Jacob, went through that were similar to Joseph. Jesus was adorned with more than a multicolored coat of favor. He was robbed in all the splendor and glory of God (Col. 1:19). He wasn’t just a favorite son of God, he was God’s unique son for he was God himself. 

And yet, like Joseph, He was sold for money by Judas (Mat 26:15). As in the story of Joseph, Jesus’ trail and crucifixion show that God subverts the evil intentions of people’s actions to bring about his ultimate plan (Acts 2:23). 

This is also seen in the story of Tamar. Tamar was pregnant with twins. Perez, one of the twins, is listed in the Gospel of Matthew in the genealogy of Jesus (Mat 1:3). God redeemed this horrific story by making Tamar and her son Perez a part of Jesus’ lineage. Even in this dark corner of the Bible, we see God working through brokenness to bring us healing. 

Jesus is far more righteous than Tamar, but unlike her situation, no one interceded for him at the cross. Instead, he was the one making intercession for us (Rom 3:25). He is both Judah and Tamar: pleading our case and taking the blame. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who can bring good out of the darkest situations. And that you would behold Jesus as the one who was stripped, defiled, sold, and killed in order to bring us into the family of God."

God provides. In the most strange, unbelievable, and dire circumstances, God provides. 

The stories in this passage are bookended with Abraham’s dealings with a king called Abimelech. Abraham tells the people of this land that his wife Sarah is actually his sister, in hopes that they will treat him well on account of Sarah’s beauty (20:2). 

So God does not allow the king to touch Sarah (20:6) for one simple reason: God was protecting Abraham’s family line. His nation would not be great because it came from a king. His nation would be great because God was with them. 

In the next story, Abraham’s long-expected son, Isaac, is born (21:2). Even in their old age, God provided in the most unbelievable circumstances. At a feast celebrating Isaac, Sarah sees Hagar, the slave with whom Abraham bore Ishmael, laughing. In another fit of jealousy, Sarah kicks her out of their estate (21:10). 

Banished in the wilderness and on the verge of watching her young child, Ishmael, die, Hagar cries out in desperation. God hears her and responds (21:17). He provides them with water and sees to it that Ishmael grows up, gets married, and multiplies into a nation just as God had promised Hagar. In the most dire circumstances, because of God’s love for Abraham, he provides a way to turn a slave woman into the matriarch of a nation. 

Where is the Gospel? 

As Abraham was protected by claiming Sarah as his sister, we are protected by claiming Jesus as our brother (Heb 2:11). God kept king Abimelech from sinning to protect Sarah, Abraham, and his descendants. Conversely, God did not keep the rulers of Jesus’ day from carrying out their sin upon him in the crucifixion (Acts 2:23). God’s chosen people were preserved in Abraham’s protection but were purchased in Jesus’ crucifixion. 

God came through on his promise at Isaac’s birth. In Jesus, he also came through on his promise of a final descendant of Abraham (Mat 1:1). The birth of Jesus proves that God is faithful to his promises. When Jesus was born, not only were Abraham and Sarah’s hopes finally met, but the pregnant hopes of the entire Old Testament were satisfied as well. 

God saved and provided for Hagar and Ishmael on account of his commitment to Abraham, even though they were outside his covenant people. God also saves and provides for us on account of his commitment to Jesus. Even if we are outside his covenant people, God brings us in because Jesus has made a way (Rom 3:24-25). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit reveals to you a God who provides everything needed to accomplish his plans and promises and that you would see Jesus as the one who ultimately provides for all those promises and hopes."

So far in Genesis, we’ve seen the promise God made about one of Eve’s offspring continue to hold true (Gen. 3:15). Through Cain murdering Abel, through flooding the whole earth, through the blessing and cursing of Noah’s children, and through the Tower of Babel, God has kept a people for himself. 

And now we get to one of the most important of Eve’s children, a man named Abram - who will later be renamed Abraham (11:29). 

God called Abram out of his land, people, and family in order to be a special and new people group unto him (12:1a). And God makes a three-part promise to Abram. 

First, God will make Abram into a great nation. He will have so many children that counting them would be like trying to count all the stars in the sky (15:5). This fulfills God’s original purpose for Adam and Eve in the garden - that they would be fruitful and multiply (1:28). 

Second, God will bless Abram. More than that, all nations will be blessed through Abram and his children (12:2). This is the fulfillment of Adam and Eve’s original purpose in the world. They were supposed to fill the world with God’s image, but the world has been filled with man’s image instead. But through Abram, God will pick up where they left off. 

Third, and last, God promises to give Abram and his children the land of Canaan. This is what you might have heard called the Promised Land (12:1b). 

In summary, God promised to make Abram into a great nation that would bless the world and live in Canaan. 

Where is the Gospel? 

But only through Jesus, the promised child of Eve and Abram, are these promises perfectly  kept. 

Jesus has made the church into a family so numerous that it is impossible to count. It is so great of a nation that it exceeds all borders, nationalities, ethnicities, social classes, and geographies (Rev 7:9). 

Through Jesus, the whole world is blessed. Anyone who puts their faith in Jesus, naming him as the one who fulfills God’s promise to Abram, is brought into this covenant relationship with God (Gal 3:8-9). They are blessed with the same blessing given to him. 

Finally, Jesus is the one who brings us into the promised land of God where we will dwell with him forever. Like Eden, the promised land was never meant to be one geographical location that we take possession of, but the starting place for a worldwide explosion of God’s glory and presence. Only Jesus will finish this promise when he returns in his glory, remakes the whole earth, and dwells with his people forever (Rev 21:3). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who is calling a people to himself and that you would see Jesus as the one who fulfills every promise of God."

Abraham’s wife Sarah has died (23:2). Isaac is the only son left through whom God will make a great nation of people. So, the question naturally arises, “Doesn’t Isaac need a wife if he’s going to have children?” That’s the story we come to next. 

Abraham is getting old. So he sends his head servant back to his home country to find Isaac a wife (24:3-4). Isaac’s wife must come from their home country and not the land of Canaan so the promised family line can remain pure. 

Upon arrival, the servant prays that God would give him a sign as to who he should bring back to marry Isaac. 

The sign he asks for is this. He will ask a woman to let down her jar into the well so that he may have a drink (24:14). The one who is to be Isaac’s wife will reply, “Yes, and let me get some water for your camels also.” Before he even finishes his prayer, the sign is fulfilled by a woman named Rebekah. 

The servant pulls out wedding jewelry and asks to meet the girl’s family. Upon meeting her family, the servant tells them everything that happened. They cannot deny that God has orchestrated this event and allow Rebekah to go with him to marry Isaac (24:50). 

Rebekah leaves with the servant, meets Isaac, and becomes his wife. God provided a wife for Isaac from the people of Abraham and brought her to the land of promise. 

Where is the Gospel? 

A similar story plays out in Jesus’ life. It’s recorded in John 4. Jesus comes to a well (John 4:6). The well is not in the promised land, but in a land called Samaria. Jews of Jesus’ day typically did not go to Samaria.

Instead of a beautiful, chaste woman, Jesus finds an adulterous woman at this well (John 4:17-18). So he makes the same request of her that the servant made of Rebekah, “Give me a drink.” The two end up having a theological conversation about geography.

As the story in Genesis draws a distinction between Abraham’s homeland and Canaan, the woman draws a distinction between her land of Samaria and Jerusalem (John 4:19). She wanted to know if her people were wrong to worship God in Samaria instead of the promised land. Jesus’ answer reveals that geography is not the issue, but belief in him (John 4:23). 

Why did Jesus orchestrate this situation to mirror the story of the servant and Rebekah? It is to show us that just as God did everything to set up the marriage that would preserve his promise and provide for his people in Rebekah, he has done everything to set up a final marriage between us and him that would accomplish his promise once and for all in Jesus. 

It also shows us that both the geographically distant and the morally distant can still approach God through Jesus. This story shows us that God does not only bring beautiful, pure, included, and obedient people, like Rebekah, into his family. He brings in rude, defiled, outcasted, and disobedient people, like the woman at the well. People like you and me.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who has organized everything to bring you into his family through Jesus Christ, no matter what you have done or where you are from. "

Isaac and Rebekah are married. God renews the covenant promise he made to Abraham by repeating it to Isaac (25:11a). It would be through Isaac that God creates his mighty nation that would bless the world. 

However, like Sarah, Rebekah is also barren and she and Isaac struggle with infertility for almost 20 years (25:21a). But God answers Isaac’s cry for help and opens Rebekah’s womb so that she becomes pregnant with twin boys. 

But think about this, if only one line is going to carry the promised blessing from God, what happens in the case of twins? Well, before either twin is even born, God tells Rebekah which one he will bless - the weaker and younger one (25:23). 

In the ancient world, the firstborn gets the father’s inheritance and his blessing. So, the rest of the story shows how God would work through human events to make good on his promise. 

First, in an act of desperation, the firstborn Esau sells his birthright to his slightly younger twin brother Jacob for a bowl of stew (25:33). That takes care of the rights of the firstborn. 

Second, at the advice of his mother, Jacob engages in an act of trickery. He tricks his elderly dad, Isaac, to give him the blessing instead of Esau (27:30). 

This story leaves us confused and with a lot of questions. Did God choose Jacob over Esau because he knew what would happen? Or maybe Rebekah helped Jacob trick his father because God told her the younger son would be blessed? But then why would God bless a liar and a trickster? Does God work through deceit? 

Where is the Gospel? 

While we may not find satisfactory answers to every question, the point of the story is still clear. The New Testament explains this story to us in Romans 9. 

We are told that God chose Jacob over Esau not because of anything good or bad they did (Rom 9:11-12). Paul writes this to prove that we are not saved based on our works. To quote Romans 9:16 exactly, “So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.” 

God chose a trickster like Jacob over Esau not because Esau was bad and Jacob was good, or the other way around. They both had serious flaws that the story highlights. God chose to show that he is merciful in and of himself. His grace is not based on our goodness. 

If you believe in Jesus today, praise God. It is not because you are smarter, luckier, or better than anyone else. It is simply because God was merciful to you. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will show you just how kind and merciful God is to save us, even though our works have done nothing to earn it. And that you would see Jesus as our older brother who gave us the birthright and blessing he deserved. "
spokengospel_Genesis 17-18:15_text,Genesis 17-18:15,Circumcision,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ec12d1cd984b7ed1155746/6402933e4b57269e986b4bf4_book-hero-ph.webp,https://www.spokengospel.com/devotionals/genesis-17-1815#read,,"In Genesis 17-18:15, we see that Jesus fulfills the sign of circumcision and gives us a new name.",Website,Genesis Bible Study,"What's Happening?

This passage is extremely important because God gives Abram a new sign of his promise (17:4). As the rainbow was a sign of the promise he made to Noah and the world, this new sign would be for Abram and the nation that would come from his line. God instructs Abram and his household to be circumcised (17:11). This may seem like a strange, possibly random sign, but it actually couldn’t be more appropriate. 

The whole book of Genesis so far has been about a descendant of Eve who would crush the head of sin and death. We learned that this descendant would come through Abram since it is through him that God would bless all nations (12:3). Therefore, God gave Abram and his people the sign of circumcision as a constant reminder that from their line, a final blessed one would come. 

This physical sign on their reproductive organs, palpably showed that this line of people was marked off for a very specific purpose. From this line, one would come who would fix the entire world. 

In renewing his covenant and giving this sign, God also changed Abram and Sarai’s name (17:4). Both name changes signify a new identity and a new reality. Abraham would be the blessed father of a multitude, and he had the sign to prove it. Sarah would be the princess of a nation. She would be barren no more. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Ultimately, we know that the final son of Abraham and Sarah who blesses all nations is Jesus. 

And Jesus gives us a sign better than the circumcision given to Abraham. Ours is a circumcision of the heart made inwardly by the Holy Spirit (Rom 2:28). The reason for an inward circumcision is that the true children of Abraham are not the ones who come straight from Abraham’s line, but those who believe in Jesus (Rom 2:29).

The Holy Spirit changing our hearts is the new sign of the covenant. 

And just as Abraham’s circumcision was a sign put on his body guaranteeing the fulfillment of the promise that was to come, the New Testament says that the Holy Spirit’s sign in us is our guarantee that all of Jesus’ promises will be fulfilled as well (2 Cor 1:22). 

Christians receive a new name as well. In fact, we are renamed twice. The first name is given to you when you put your faith in Jesus. You are made a new creation (2 Cor 5:17). At that moment, you are given so many new names: Bride of Christ (2 Cor 11:2), Adopted Son or Daughter (8:16), Beloved of God (Rom 1:7). The list goes on and on. 

There is a second name every Christian will receive as well. The last book in the Bible, Revelation, says that Jesus will give new names to everyone who perseveres to the end (Rev 2:17). No one knows what this name is or will be. It may be that Jesus gives each of us a private name only he calls us. A sweet pet name between us and our Savior.  That’s a name worth looking forward to. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God of faithfulness and that you would see that Jesus has given us his Spirit as a guarantee of what is to come. "

But for God’s people, Jesus rose from the dead, proving the weapon of all the world’s Pharaohs and empires are useless against his plans to save.",Website,Habakkuk Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Israel is suffering under the injustice of her own leaders. So Habakkuk prays that God will free Israel from her own leaders like he liberated Israel from slavery under Pharaoh in Egypt (Habakkuk 3:2).

Habakkuk wants God to show up like he did on Mount Sinai, clothed in bright light and shaking the earth (Habakkuk 3:4; Exodus 19:16, 18). Just as God turned rivers to blood and split the Red Sea apart for Israel, he wants God to do so again against Israel’s current leadership (Habakkuk 3:8, 10). Habakkuk wants new plagues to fall and the rivers to turn to blood once more (Habakkuk 3:5, 8). But this time Habakkuk wants God’s victory to be final. Borrowing language from God’s promise to Eve, he asks that God would soon save his chosen but bruised people by crushing the head of every leader like Pharaoh (Genesis 3:15; Habakkuk 3:13).

As Habakkuk remembers all that God did to Egypt, his body trembles at the thought of living in Israel as God judges her (Habakkuk 3:16). But mixed with his fear is a willingness to patiently wait for God’s restoration. Even if Israel wastes away under the evil of a new conquering nation, even if all God’s plagues fall from the sky, even if there is no fig or olive left in Israel, he will rejoice in the God who saves (Habakkuk 3:17-18). Habakkuk knows God will be his strength, and that one day soon, like a deer, he will freely wander the hills of Israel again (Habakkuk 3:19).

Where is the Gospel?

Earlier in his prophecies, Habakkuk says that the righteous will live by faith (Habakkuk 2:4). “Faith” means patiently waiting for God’s justice. Faith is trusting that God will make things right soon despite the desolation around us. Habakkuk also knew that patiently waiting for God meant patiently waiting for another nation to come and destroy Israel (Habakkuk 1:6, 10). Habakkuk knew God’s salvation would only come after Israel was desolated even further.

That further desolation happened when Babylon conquered Israel. But it happened again when Israel’s true Leader, Jesus, was nailed to a cross. Like God’s people were exiled by Babylon, Jesus was buried by Rome. And a new plague of darkness descended on Jerusalem, just as it did in Egypt (Luke 23:44). Jesus, the ruler of Israel, was desolated just as Habakkuk prayed. But just as Genesis promised, Jesus’ death was only a bruise. Evil was defeated, and both God’s chosen Son and people were saved when Jesus rose from the desolation of his grave.

God’s people are still desolated by the injustice of their leaders. But the true leader of God’s people is Jesus. No matter how our pastors or spiritual leaders might devastate the reputation of God’s Church or harm the people they are supposed to protect, Jesus has risen from the dead. He is forever the leader who will never abuse his people. He will put himself in harm’s way rather than harm one of his own. And for those who patiently endure, they will see the restoration—under Jesus’ leadership—of all they have lost.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who comes to judge evil. And may you see Jesus as the one who is coming to destroy all the world’s evil powers."

Jesus is the good leader and judge Israel never had, and under his leadership, the world is brought peace.",Website,Micah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The book of Micah is split into three court cases. In this second court case, Micah calls the judges and prophets of Israel to hear God’s accusation and verdict (Micah 3:1).

Instead of using their courtrooms for justice, Israel’s judges use them to cannibalize their citizens and make themselves rich (Micah 3:2-3). And the prophets reward the corrupt with promises of “peace” while going to war against the citizens who can’t afford to bribe them off (Micah 3:5). Israel’s leaders are guilty of building their nation on the blood of those they are charged to protect (Micah 3:10). Their sentence is perfect justice. The judges who refuse to listen to the plight of the poor will not be listened to by God (Micah 3:4). The prophets who used to speak for God will be met with terrifying divine silence (Micah 3:6-7). And the kingdom these corrupt men have built will be plowed like a field and turned to rubble by a new and more powerful king (Micah 3:12).

But Micah also prophesies that after God has leveled this oppressive version of Israel he will raise Jerusalem up into a city on a hill where perfect justice reigns (Micah 4:1-2). Israel and her rulers will have a new reputation of justice—and the nations will flock to Israel to learn more (Micah 4:3). Israel will cause peace to spread as she administers global justice and repurposes weapons of war into tools of growth and new life (Micah 4:3-4). Israel will become a safe haven for those previously taken advantage of (Micah 4:6-7). And God will crown a leader who will rule the earth with justice (Micah 4:8).

The threat of an army coming to exile Israel shouldn’t make them doubt this promise (Micah 4:9). God is a master strategist.God uses exile and oppression to bring freedom and rescue to Israel. Like labor pain prophesies the birth of a child, their pain in exile will be a sure sign that a new king and kingdom are coming (Micah 4:10)! The enemy might think they’ve won, but God will use their victory to destroy their kingdom and establish his people as rulers over all the earth (Micah 4:12-13).

Micah says this new global kingdom will begin in insignificant Bethlehem (Micah 5:2). The leader prophesied by Israel’s labor pains will be born there (Micah 5:3). In power and strength, he will shepherd Israel into their land and bring peace to the world (Micah 5:4-6). To ensure this kingdom lasts forever, God will remove every temptation that led Israel’s leaders astray in the first place. Militaries will be broken down (Micah 5:10-11). Idols will be removed (Micah 5:13). And all enemies of God and all empires devoted to evil will be torn down (Micah 5:15).

Where is the Gospel?

The Kingdom of justice and peace prophesied by Micah began when Jesus was born in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:1). He is the child of Israel’s labor in exile. And he is the rightful King of Israel who disarms the corrupt of their positions of power and ushers in a final age of peace and justice for the world (Mark 1:15). Jesus is the culmination of God’s strategies and council. Just as God used a powerful nation to judge Israel’s leaders, and used Israel’s exile to birth a new Kingdom, God uses the oppression of Rome and the corruption of Israel’s religious establishment to crown his Son as King over all nations (Acts 2:24). Not even death can threaten King Jesus, so there can be no end to the justice he establishes on earth for his people.

The good news is that the child Micah hoped for has been born and the governments of the world rest on his shoulders. Jesus is our Wonderful Strategist (Isaiah 9:6). And he has not just raised up a new Kingdom but also new citizens and leaders. All those who trust in Jesus’ kingship inherit God’s Kingdom. As God promised and by his Spirit, we are cleansed of the sin that plagued Israel’s leadership. We have God’s eternal law of justice stamped on our hearts (Hebrews 10:16). As God’s new people and members of his Kingdom, we have been given authority to rule alongside God and see justice return to the world.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who overthrows injustice by sending us a King. And may you see Jesus as the King who empowers us to rule and reign in his Kingdom.

God has just relented of the disaster he warned Nineveh about—and Jonah is angry (Jonah 3:10-4:1). Nineveh is the capital of Assyria, an ancient superpower that will soon invade Israel and exile its people. But Jonah has made a name for himself in Israel by prophesying a golden era of military dominance (2 Kings 14:24-25). Nineveh's repentance is a threat to both his career and Israel as a nation. To Jonah, God’s mercy towards these pagans is dangerous.

In Hebrew, Jonah calls God’s mercy “evil.” Jonah says God’s love and mercy are exactly why he ran away in the first place (Jonah 4:2). Jonah did not want to be complicit in the salvation of Nineveh. He would rather die than live to watch God show mercy towards Israel’s enemies (Jonah 4:3). But God asks if Jonah's anger is justified (Jonah 4:4).  

Jonah dismisses the question, storms out of Nineveh, and broods on a nearby hilltop. He waits for God to renege on his mercy and destroy the city (Jonah 4:5). But instead, God is merciful to Jonah and sends a plant to shade him on the hot day (Jonah 4:6). We’re told it “eased his discomfort.” But that same phrase can also mean “save him from evil.” God is using the plant to expose Jonah’s hateful heart that calls God’s mercy evil. 

God sends a worm to destroy the plant and sends a hot wind to bring further discomfort to Jonah (Jonah 4:7-8). Jonah wants to die under God’s heat and is angry because God has taken away the mercy of the plant. But hoping to expose Jonah’s hypocrisy, God asks again if his anger is justified (Jonah 4:9a). 

Jonah responds that he has the right to be angry  (Jonah 4:9b). To Jonah, he deserves shade—and Nineveh deserves fire. Not to mention, Nineveh and Assyria represent a military threat to God’s people. To Jonah, it makes no sense to show mercy to evil people while God’s people suffer in the heat. But Jonah doesn’t see the irony in his self-pity and pride. 

Jonah is a faithless, disobedient, and blasphemous prophet. Jonah has been God’s enemy since the first verse of this book. Jonah has refused to listen to God. Jonah has run from God. Jonah never repents. And Jonah accuses God of being evil. Jonah has been mercifully and undeservedly shaded from God’s heat, but resents the mercy God has shown to undeserving but repentant Nineveh. 

God calls out Jonah’s hypocrisy. Jonah didn’t care for or water his plant, just as he did not earn or qualify himself for the mercy of God’s shade (Jonah 4:10). So God asks: if Jonah is justified in caring about the plant that he did not earn, isn’t God justified in showing mercy to the other undeserving humans he created in Nineveh (Jonah 4:11)?  

Where is the Gospel?

We never hear Jonah’s response to God’s question. The question is left unanswered intentionally and every reader of Jonah’s book needs to ask themselves, “Do we believe God’s mercy is evil?” When faced with the military and political threat of Nineveh, would we have prayed for their deliverance? Like Jesus, would we forgive the terrorist who hung on the cross next to us? If we were a Jew under Nazi rule, would we preach the Gospel to the Gestappo? And would we be angry if God forgave them?

Just as God gave Jonah the plant, God has given us Jesus to expose our hypocrisy and bring us to repentance. Jesus’ death on the cross should reveal to us that we’re just as faithless, disobedient, and blasphemous as Jonah. We’ve been God’s enemy since the first days of our lives. We refuse to listen to God. We run from God. We hate to repent. We accuse God of being evil. And like Jonah we demand God’s mercy, thinking we deserve it, while resenting God’s mercy towards our enemies. 

But the good news is that Jesus died only for sinners and enemies (Romans 5:8). Clearer than a withered plant, Jesus' death shades us from God’s hot anger at hypocrisy and pride (1 John 2:2). The cross reveals that God would rather die himself than allow one undeserving enemy who repents to wither. Our anger is never justified when God forgives enemies because that would mean God is not justified in forgiving you and me (Romans 3:25-26). So like Nineveh, let God’s mercy lead you to repent and be saved. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is merciful. And may you see Jesus as the one who shades us so that his people might be saved. "

",Website,Jonah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jonah is the only prophetic book that doesn’t focus on the prophet’s prophecies about Israel, but on the prophet himself. Jonah’s life is the prophecy. And Jonah’s descent into the sea for failing to deliver God’s message to Nineveh, represents Israel’s exile for failing to live up to her calling as a nation. 

Israel was supposed to proclaim to all nations the abounding love and coming justice of God. In doing so, Israel would bless the world (Exodus 34:6-7, Genesis 22:18). But this is the precise message Jonah refused to give to his enemies, the Assyrians, whose capital is Nineveh (Jonah 1:2). And so, for Jonah’s disobedience, God sends a fish to swallow up his prophet (Jonah 1:17) and offer Jonah’s readers a prophetic picture of Israel's coming descent into the belly of exile.

In the fish and underwater, Jonah is barely alive, but he prays (Jonah 2:1). Copying many of the Psalms, Jonah begins with the hope that God has already heard his prayer (Jonah 2:2). Jonah knows    what the psalmist meant when he said all God’s waves and breakers cover him (Psalm 42:7, Jonah 2:3). Seaweed wraps around his drowning body as he descends further to the roots of the continents (Jonah 2:5-6a). 

So far in the story, Jonah has only gone down—down to Joppa, down into the boat, down into the water, down the fish’s throat, and now down to the ocean floor (Jonah 1:3, 5, 15). But at the bottom he prays to the God who can bring him up (Jonah 2:6b-7). Only God can end his exile among the depths.

Jonah then warns that unfaithful pagans will not experience God’s love (Jonah 2:8). Strangely, as readers we know they already have. The pagan sailors’ lives were spared from God’s storm against Jonah. Jonah then says he’ll make vows and sacrifices to God, unlike those of the pagans. But again, we know the sailors have already made sacrifices and vows to Jonah’s God (Jonah 1:16, Jonah 2:9). Jonah’s prayer is sincere, and Jonah is confident that God will save him (Jonah 2:9). But his prayer is marked by a blindness to what God has done among the pagan sailors, and will soon do in Nineveh (Jonah 3:10). Jonah knows God can save, but Jonah cannot fathom that mercy would extend to his enemies.

And then God tells the fish to vomit Jonah onto the shore (Jonah 2:10).

Where is the Gospel?

Many of the prophets describe Israel’s exile like a swallowing. The prophet Amos described Israel’s coming exile as a descent into the bottom of the sea where a giant sea snake would devour them (Amos 9:3). The prophet Jeremiah describes Israel’s exile like being swallowed by a monster of the deep (Jeremiah 51:34). And even historically, when the Assyrian king finally exiles Israel, he takes a giant hook, rams it through the king of Israel’s nose, and drags him off the throne like a fish (2 Chronicles 33:11-12). Jonah is about more than a big fish. Jonah’s life is a prophecy. Jonah is a sign. He represents Israel and the consequences for failing to live up to her calling. 

This is why Jesus calls Jonah a sign, and himself an even greater sign (Matthew 12:39, 41). Like Jonah was swallowed by the fish and Israel was swallowed by Assyria, so too Jesus will be swallowed by the earth and by Roman power (Matthew 12:40). Just as Jonah did in the fish, Jesus quotes the Psalms from the cross (Psalm 22:1). Like Jonah, Jesus represents God’s people, and his descent below represents a coming exile. Like Jonah, Jesus’ death is a sign of coming judgment against all who refuse God’s call. The earth beneath will swallow us forever (Jonah 2:6b). But Jesus’ death is also a sign of a coming resurrection. Jonah didn’t die in the fish. Israel didn’t die in exile. And the grave vomited Jesus back out. In the belly of the fish, Jonah says salvation belongs to God—and Jesus proves Jonah right (Jonah 2:9)!

But salvation is not limited to those we deem worthy of receiving it. Jonah wanted to choose who heard the message of God’s love and salvation. His self-righteous prayer couldn’t imagine God had changed the hearts of the sailors, much less given them life after certain death. But God is the God who saves and shows mercy to the unworthy. He judges and exiles himself to the grave so that everyone who believes in him can have eternal life (John 3:16). So whether you are Jew or Gentile, oppressed or oppressor, sinned against or sinner, there is salvation in Jesus!

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who warns and sends signs. And may you see Jesus as the one who died in the depths of the earth so that we may have life with God. "

",Website,Jonah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The book of Jonah is not about a big fish. It’s about the mercy God has for his enemies. 

The book begins with God’s word coming to Jonah the son of Amittai (Jonah 1:1). This isn’t the first time Jonah appears in the Bible. Jonah was a prophet for the evil king Jeroboam II (2 Kings 14:24-25). While other prophets, like Amos, were busy denouncing Jeroboam, Jonah prophesied the expansion of Israel's territory and implicitly gave God’s seal of approval to the wicked king (Amos 7:9-11).

Nevertheless, God tells Jonah to preach against Nineveh and its wickedness (Jonah 1:2). Nineveh was the capital city of Assyria; a pagan nation that would eventually exile Israel and burn down Jerusalem. So instead of delivering God’s message to Israel’s enemy, Jonah gets on a boat with other pagans and heads to the farthest point on the map he can find (Jonah 1:3). We’re told later that Jonah refuses to preach to Nineveh because he knows God will be merciful (Jonah 4:2). Jonah couldn’t stomach a message of mercy going to Israel’s enemies. But as soon as the boat hits the water, God throws a tempest at the stowed-away Jonah (Jonah 1:4). 

The storm highlights the differences between the penitent pagan sailors and the rogue prophet. The sailors are terrified but earnest. They call out to their gods for help and throw everything off the boat to stay afloat. But Jonah is unaware and sleeping (Jonah 1:5). The captain shakes Jonah awake and uses the same words God used in verse one. The captain asks Jonah to “get up” and “call” out to his God too (Jonah 1:6). But Jonah never does.

The crew throws a kind of dice, hoping God will direct them to the culprit of the storm (Jonah 1:7). It’s only when the die indicates Jonah is to blame, that Jonah admits anything (Jonah 1:9-10). Then Jonah gives up. He tells the sailors to throw him into the sea (Jonah 1:12). But the sailors do everything they can to save his life (Jonah 1:13). Even when they realize their only hope is to throw Jonah overboard, they ask God for forgiveness first (Jonah 1:14). 

Finally, they throw Jonah overboard and the storm stops. Immediately, the sailors show honor to Jonah’s God and offer a sacrifice with whatever is left on board (Jonah 1:15-16). And while the sailors enjoy the sun and calm sea, Jonah is swallowed by a big fish and taken deep under the water (Jonah 1:17).

Where is the Gospel?

Much of Jesus’ ministry was spent with people like Jonah’s pagan sailors. Prostitutes and tax collectors experienced Jesus' mercy and compassion. Even a couple of Jesus’ disciples were fishermen sailors (Luke 5:30). Many that Jesus healed were also ethnic descendants of nations like Assyria and cities like Nineveh (Matthew 8:5). They were called Gentiles. And like Jonah, the religious leaders of Jesus’ day couldn’t stomach a message of mercy going out to Israel’s religious and historic enemies. The Pharisees also demanded increasingly explicit signs to “prove'' the message they didn’t want to hear (Matthew 16:1). Jesus calls them an “evil and adulterous generation” and says he’ll only give them the sign of Jonah (Matthew 16:4). 

Jesus’ opponents need to rediscover the story of Jonah because they are Jonah. They’re hard-hearted prophets more interested in preserving Israel’s national identity than extending mercy to Israel’s cultural and spiritual enemies. And they’re surrounded by penitent pagans who see clearly what God is up to and repent (Matthew 12:41-42).They’re so devoted to denying God’s call and running from God’s mercy, like Jonah, they’re headed for the jaws of the deep.

But the sign of Jonah is also about Jesus’ death. Just as Jonah spent three nights underwater, Jesus will spend three days in the belly of the earth (Matthew 12:40). This is the final sign to an evil and unmerciful generation that God will save his enemies while submerging those who refuse his message. Jonah’s “death” in the sea meant the pagan sailors were saved from the storm, and they believed and called out to God (Jonah 3:5). Similarly, Jesus’ death means there are calm waters and forgiveness ahead, even for God’s enemies (Romans 5:10). 

Jonah challenges us to name the people we believe don’t deserve God’s mercy. And while we all have someone we would refuse to preach mercy to, Jesus never does. Like Jonah he will descend to the depths so God’s enemies can receive his mercy.  

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who sends prophets against evil. And may you see Jesus as a greater Jonah offering mercy to God’s enemies.

",Website,Jonah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jonah has been vomited onto the shore, and God calls him once again to proclaim his message to the great city of Nineveh (Jonah 3:1-2). Nineveh is called a “great city” back in Genesis 10, where we learn a violent man named Nimrod is responsible for establishing both Nineveh and Babylon—the capital cities of the nations that will send Israel into exile (Genesis 10:9-10). We’re also told Nineveh takes three days to walk across. It’s a not-so-subtle hint that Jonah is walking into the belly of bigger and badder fish, an ancient enemy city all too eager to swallow God’s people whole. And as a fun sidenote, the god of Nineveh was the half-fish deity, Dagon.

Once there, Jonah finally delivers the message he almost died avoiding. It’s a tense, five-word sermon in Hebrew: “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown” (Jonah 3:4). It’s a ridiculously anemic speech. It doesn’t mention who will overthrow Nineveh, if God will even be involved, or how to avoid the coming overthrowing. The word “overthrow” is also ambiguous. It could mean “destroyed in judgment” like it was used when Sodom and Gomorrah were set on fire (Genesis 19:25). Or it could mean “transform” like when God turned the false prophet Balaam’s curse into a blessing for Israel (​​Deuteronomy 23:5). Which is exactly what’s about to happen to Jonah. What Jonah hoped would solidify the Ninevites' destruction, brings about their transformation. 

Nineveh believes God and repents (Jonah 3:5a). Both the powerful and the poor fast and replace their clothes with old sacks as signs of destitution and emptiness before the God they’ve wronged and from whom they need mercy (Jonah 3:5b). Even the king of Nineveh recognizes his evil and repents (Jonah 3:6). And he formalizes the revival that began among his subjects (Jonah 3:7). He even orders the cows and sheep in Nineveh to fast and be covered in sackcloth to demonstrate the total repentance of their evil (Jonah 3:8)! Much like the captain of the sailors didn’t know if they would be saved from the storm (Jonah 1:6), the king doesn’t know if this repentance will be enough to turn back God’s anger and save them from dying (Jonah 3:9). But God sees how the people of Nineveh turn, and overturns the threatened destruction (Jonah 1:10). To Jonah’s deep disappointment, Nineveh

 

is

 

overthrown, just not in the way he hoped. 

Where is the Gospel?

Jonah chapter three is a mirror of Jonah chapter one. In both chapters, the faithfulness of the pagans is contrasted with Jonah’s resistance and reluctance. Both the unnamed captain of the sailors and the unnamed king of Nineveh are more faithful than Jonah. And both the captain and the king save their people in spite of Jonah’s “best” efforts. God transforms destruction into salvation for those who call on him, and he’ll even use the faithless Jonah to make it happen.

This is the pattern in both the story of Jonah and of Jesus. Like the faithless Jonah, the Jewish Pharisees couldn’t stomach salvation being preached to people they deemed worthy of destruction (Matthew 23:13). Eventually, the Pharisees killed Jesus with an ironic tersely-worded verdict hung above his cross: “Jesus, King of the Jews.” But what they thought was a sarcastic jab was overthrown. And according to the apostle Paul, God overthrew Israel’s faithlessness so that the rest of the world might trust Jesus (Romans 11:11). The faithlessness of some has led to salvation for all and offers hope that the initially unfaithful (like Jonah and Israel) might once again return (Romans 11:11b).

But regardless of whether you are Jewish or not, God’s message to us is the one Jonah delivered. He is coming to overthrow. He will either overthrow you and your evil in his great anger, or he will transform you into a citizen of his Kingdom and a recipient of his blessing in his great mercy on the cross. So turn, repent, and ask God for mercy—and you will be saved. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is coming to overthrow. And may you see Jesus as the one who transforms us into citizens of his Kingdom by faith alone. "

",Website,Habakkuk Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Habakkuk asks God two questions, and God responds twice.

Habakkuk knows God is good, so his first question is, Why does God tolerate evil? (Habakkuk 1:3) The king Jehoiakim is on the throne and he’s leading Israel into a renewed season of corruption and depravity (Jeremiah 22:13-14). Jehoiakim is a murderer, Israel’s priests ignore God’s law, Israel’s judges are corrupt, and her people suffer under their collective injustice (Habakkuk 1:4). Habakkuk rightly wonders how long God will tolerate evil (Habakkuk 1:2)

But God responds that he is planning such thorough justice against Israel’s corruption that Habakkuk won’t believe it (Habakkuk 1:5). God is raising up the Babylonians to wipe out Israel’s corruption and her leaders’ violence (Habakkuk 1:6, 10).

But this brings up a worse issue for Habakkuk. The Babylonians are far worse than Israel (Habakkuk 1:13). The Babylonians treat their enemies like animals (Habakkuk 1:15). They exploit and consume their conquered foes (Habakkuk 1:16). The Babylonians are merciless killers (Habakkuk 1:17). To Habakkuk, God’s answer has just deepened the problem. God isn’t just allowing evil to go unchecked; he’s using evil for his own purposes. Habakkuk’s second question is, How can God use evil if God is good?

And God’s answer is that Habakkuk must trust a vision (Habakkuk 2:2-3). The vision details that Babylon and all kingdoms like it will fall. God will bring down all nations built on theft and greed (Habakkuk 2:6). God will cut down every palace built on the backs of the oppressed (Habakkuk 2:10-11). God will imprison any empire built through slavery (Habakkuk 2:12-13), and destroy each imperial cult honoring inept gods and leaders (Habakkuk 2:18). That means Israel will be destroyed by Babylon, but Babylon will eventually be destroyed by yet another proud nation. God will continuously use evil to judge evil until there is no evil left to judge. Then, God will inaugurate a globe-spanning Kingdom that floods the earth with true justice and glory (Habakkuk 2:14). The answer to Habakkuk’s second question is to trust that this is the best way evil gets what it deserves.

Where is the Gospel?

Habakkuk has asked the right questions. Habakkuk wants to know why God allows evil to continue and why he uses the unjust to accomplish his purposes. God’s response is that this won’t always be the case. One day evil will be torn down, and the innocent, enslaved, and poor will finally experience justice. While no answer fully explains God’s toleration of evil, it’s significant that God doesn’t say the righteous live by satisfied curiosity or answered questions. Instead, they live by trusting that he will soon make things right (Habakkuk 2:3-4).

This is difficult. It is not easy. But in Jesus, we are given the same answer to Habakkuk’s question—just intensified and made flesh. In the book of Luke Jesus begins his ministry with the same vision that God gave Habakkuk. Jesus had come to topple the forces of evil and injustice, and inaugurate a global reign of justice and glory for the oppressed (Luke 4:18-19). In Jesus, Habakkuk’s hoped-for Kingdom comes!

But just as Israel was judged by Babylon, Jesus would be judged by Rome. Jesus was the King of Israel, a nation that long ago gave herself over to evil and depravity. And for a moment, that hope in his Kingdom died on the cross. But God did not allow the evil of Rome to win; he used evil for his own purposes (Acts 2:24). God used evil to judge evil until there was no evil left to judge.

In Jesus, Israel’s evil was buried. And Rome’s evil was powerless to stop his resurrection. So Jesus ascended to a throne of universal sovereignty. And now, with absolute authority, he promises that the innocent will not die at the hands of the unjust. Instead, they will live forever by trusting that the coming day of justice and glory prophesied by Habakkuk has begun in him. And Jesus promises that a day is coming soon when evil will no longer be tolerated because there will be no evil at all.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who co-opts the evil of kingdoms. And may you see Jesus as trustworthy to bring a Kingdom of justice to all who are oppressed."

Like Micah, Jesus embodies the laments of Israel even to the point of death.",Website,Micah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The book of Micah is split into three court cases. In the last court case, God calls the mountains to hear Micah’s lawsuit against Israel (Micah 6:1). They are objective and long-standing observers to both Israel’s evil and God’s grace towards them. The mountains stood when God liberated them from Egypt (Micah 6:4). And the mountains observed how God faithfully protected and delivered Israel into their promised land (Micah 6:5). The mountains have seen how God has graciously given Israel everything.

Micah pivots and asks what a God like this wants from his people (Micah 6:6a). The leaders of Micah’s day assumed God wanted increasingly extravagant sacrifices, even offering their own children to satisfy their sense of religious debt (Micah 6:6b-7). But God desires justice, kindness, and true humility before him (Micah 6:8).

Failing this, God tells Jerusalem’s leaders that they have received too little justice for their wickedness (Micah 6:10). The time has come for justice. God will not acquit the corrupt and violent within her walls (Micah 6:11-12). Instead, an ironic justice will mark Jerusalem’s efforts. They will eat and never be full (Micah 6:14). They will sow but never harvest. They will make wine but never enjoy it (Micah 6:15). And soon Jerusalem will self-destruct by God’s hand (Micah 6:16).

Micah then embodies the laments of Israel. He says Israel is like a man looking for figs, but only finding leaves (Micah 7:1). No matter where he looks there are no just leaders or godly rulers to be found (Micah 7:2). So he waits in hope for the day of God’s salvation (Micah 7:7).

Micah knows Israel must pay for her sin, and that Jerusalem will fall. But Micah also knows that one day God will take up Israel’s case and bring her into light and justice for all she has suffered (Micah 7:9). He’s confident God will restore Israel’s land, and that all the nations of the earth will find safety and peace within her borders (Micah 7:11-12). Like a shepherd, God will guide his flock into new, larger, and more peaceful pastures (Micah 7:14). And like a shepherd He will crush any snake-like enemies who try to attack God’s sheep (Micah 7:16-17).

Where is the Gospel?

The day of God’s salvation that Micah waited for, is the day Jesus turned over the tables in the temple. In that action, Jesus acted as a true King of Israel and condemned Israel’s corrupt leaders and their hypocritical worship of God (Matthew 21:12-13). Like Micah, Jesus came to Jerusalem looking for true worship and justice among her leaders—and found only snakes instead (Matthew 12:34). That’s why in many of the Gospel accounts Jesus immediately finds a fig tree with no fruit after his visit in the temple (Matthew 21:19a). Jesus is like Micah searching for godly leaders and finding none.

And as Micah expects, Jerusalem and her leaders are condemned. As a prophetic symbol of the temple’s future, Jesus curses the fig tree, and it withers (Matthew 21:19b). Later Jesus prophesies that not one stone of Jerusalem’s temple will be left on top of the other (Matthew 24:2). Jerusalem’s leaders and their monument to false religion would crumble, and in its place, Jesus will build a new temple in himself (John 2:19).

Jesus’ death on the cross embodies the fate of Jerusalem, her leadership, and its false worship. Jesus, the King of Israel, takes her case and dies for Jerusalem’s accumulated sin. But when he rises from the darkness, he raises all his people into light, justice, true worship, and forgiveness.

Micah’s name means “Who is like God?” And the answer is—no one is like Micah’s God. (Micah 7:18). No other god forgives after a history-worth of disobedience. No other god delights in love and refuses to hold onto his anger (Micah 7:18). No other god but Jesus throws past sins into the sea and invites all nations into his new Kingdom (Micah 7:19).

But we also see that Jesus will protect his people and give them a Kingdom of safety and peace. ",Website,Micah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The book of Micah is split into three court cases. In the first, the prophet Micah calls the nations of the world to hear God’s verdict against Israel (Micah 1:2). God will leave his home, come to earth, and smash the idols, temples, and shrines of Israel (Micah 1:3).

The evidence that demands this verdict are the capital cities of Samaria and Jerusalem. These twin centers of power have become twin centers of idolatry (Micah 1:5). Israel’s capitals and leadership have institutionalized their rejection of God’s call to love God, love neighbor, and bless the world. So God promises to turn Samaria to rubble (Micah 1:6). He warns that Samaria is like a festering wound that has already infected Judah, and whose sepsis has arrived at the gates of Jerusalem (Micah 1:9).

Listing city after Judean city, Micah turns each of the town’s names into an omen of coming judgment. Shaphir means beautiful, so Micah warns the beautiful town will be stripped naked for the pleasure of her enemies (Micah 1:11a). Lachish was one of the most technologically and militarily advanced cities in Judah (2 Chronicles 11:8-10). But Micah says Israel’s investment in her military was the beginning of her moral rot (Micah 1:13). Instead of leading the nation into their calling to bless the world (Deuteronomy 16:20; 17:18-20), Israel’s leaders have robbed their citizens to prop up their military and monarchy (Micah 2:1-2). And just as God promised to end the idolatry of Samaria, he promises to end Israel’s corruption and worship of war by dismantling Jerusalem and giving her land to a conquering army (Micah 2:3-4).

The prophets of Israel were meant to guide her leaders to follow God’s law and warn them of the consequences of breaking it. Instead, they’re willingly blind toward the leaders’ abuses and use their religious authority to tell the people nothing is wrong with Israel’s leadership and nothing bad is going to happen to them (Micah 2:6-8). But Micah’s prophecies come true. The nation of Assyria carts Samaria off into exile (2 Kings 17:5). And Assyria’s king Sennacherib fulfills each of Micah’s prophecies against the towns mentioned earlier (2 Kings 18:13). Refugees flee to the last stronghold of Israel—Jerusalem—just in time for Assyria to arrive at the gates, ready to destroy Israel’s capital.

But Micah prophesies that God is not a butcher. God has not gathered Israel for slaughter, but like a shepherd has penned in his sheep to protect them (Micah 2:12). Assyria’s blockade will not end in slaughter. God will rescue his people, break through Assyria’s siege, and lead his people to victory (Micah 2:13).

Where is the Gospel?

This prophecy comes true during the reign of King Hezekiah. Surrounded by a 185,000-man Assyrian blockade, Hezekiah prays. And overnight, God breaks through the Assyrian offensive and frees his people (2 Kings 19:19, 35). Hezekiah might have been on the throne but God was Israel’s true Shepherd and King. And for us, God in Jesus is our Shepherd-King forever.

Jesus calls himself our Good Shepherd (John 10:11). And as God lured Assyria to Israel’s gates only to lead Israel to victory, Jesus allows the forces of idolatrous Rome, corrupt religion, and abusive leaders to set up their blockade - only to break through death itself. Jesus now sits enthroned above every earthly power (Ephesians 1:21). He’s the King of a Kingdom not built on the worship of war or political power (John 18:36).

Jesus is a Shepherd-King, and he longs to gather his people into his protective care (Matthew 23:37). Yes, it might look like the empires of the world are winning for a time, but none can snatch God’s own from his hand (John 10:10). Jesus would rather die than see one little lamb lost from his flock (Matthew 18:12). And Jesus is planning victory for his sheep even when all we see are butchers and wolves.

Micah’s court cases against Israel’s capital cities remind those that use their power to push down the weak will one day be declared guilty. But they also promise that God will declare that his sheep will become the inheritors of the new Kingdom of peace and justice.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who judges idolatry and corruption. And may you see Jesus as the Good Shepherd-King who leads his people into peace and justice.

",Website,Obadiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Obadiah is a prophet who receives a vision from God about Edom (Obadiah 1). Edom is Israel’s neighbor on the other side of the Dead Sea. But more importantly this nation is not just Israel’s neighbor, they are also Israel’s brother. The nations of Israel and Edom descended from two brothers introduced in Genesis: Jacob and Esau (Genesis 25:23). From birth, these twins had a contentious relationship because God chose to keep his covenant with Jacob and Israel instead of Esau and Edom (Genesis 27:41).

By Obadiah’s day this tension was centuries old and had turned to war. Israel had declined in political and military power, and was under siege by an enemy nation. Edom gloats over their brother’s demise, takes advantage of their brother’s weakened position, and plunders Israel to make Edom more wealthy (Obadiah 12-13). Pride is Edom’s chief sin (Obadiah 3). The impenetrable mountainside caves they lived in made them feel invincible even before God. They thought they were like an eagle, soaring above everyone else (Obadiah 4). Their pride kept them from helping Israel on her day of trouble. Instead, they gambled over the city's loot after the pillagers had done their worst (Obadiah 11). 

So God says that he will bring Edom, in their pride, crashing down (Obadiah 10). They won’t just be ransacked like a home picked over by a thief, they will be brought to nothing (Obadiah 5, 9). Edom will be destroyed because their pride led them to harm God’s chosen people and believe they were beyond the reach of his hand. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Like Obadiah, Jesus prophesied against the prideful in his day too. He said, “All those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted” (Luke 18:14). And we see a clear picture of this at the cross. Jesus, though he should have been exalted, humbled himself to death. 

Like the Edomites did in Israel, those around Jesus’ cross pridefully gambled over his pillaged body (Matthew 27:35). And like the Edomites gloated over Israel during her destruction, those who crucified Jesus gloated and hurled insults at him as he suffered (Matthew 27:39). Their pride made them feel invincible, even before God’s Son on the cross. It may seem like an overstatement, but we are like Edom and those pridefully present at the crucifixion. Because like Edom, and in pride, we believe we are beyond the reach of God’s hand. We need Obadiah’s warning because it is Jesus’ warning as well. The humble Jesus on the cross will return and be exalted. And all those who pridefully exalt themselves will be humbled by him (Matthew 23:12). Like Edom, they will be utterly destroyed. 

But the good news is that prideful people like us can still be saved by our humble Savior Jesus. While we were gambling for his clothes, he was dying for our sins (Luke 23:34). If we humble ourselves, admit our pride, and confess our false belief that we are beyond God’s justice and hand, we will be lifted up. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who humbles the proud. And that you will see Jesus as the exalted one who humbled himself to save proud brothers like us.

",Website,Obadiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

Obadiah prophesies that a “day of the Lord” is coming (Obadiah 15). And on that day God will ensure that every evil deed done against Israel will curve back around and be done to the perpetrators. Those who ransack Israel and drink wine from its conquered vineyards, will soon drink the wine of God’s wrath instead (Obadiah 16). The land they conquer will become the place God conquers them (Obadiah 17). And those who destroy Israel like a consuming fire, will be consumed by the fire soon to come out of Israel (Obadiah 18). 

But Obadiah also describes the day of the Lord as a fulfillment of Israel’s conquest of the promised land that began in the book of Joshua (Obadiah 20). Israel never fully conquered that land, but Obadiah predicts a day when Israel will possess the whole land, along with her enemies and their surrounding territories (Obadiah 19). The day of the Lord won’t just be a day of proportionate justice against Israel’s enemies, but a day of victory for Israel herself.

So Obadiah’s prophecy ends with a picture of the leaders of Israel (called deliverers or messiahs) ruling Edom from its mountain stronghold (Obadiah 21). The choice of the nation “Edom” is intentional. It’s a play on the word “adam” which means “humanity.” Obadiah is saying that on the day of the Lord, God will raise Israel’s messiahs to co-rule with God over all nations. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Obadiah’s prophecy of the day of the Lord is about much more than one piece of land, a few enemy nations, and an unfinished conquest. The day of the Lord is about how God will set up an eternal Kingdom over the whole world. It is about how all people from all nations and all times will have their deeds curve back around and be done to them. And it is about how God will provide deliverance for his people alongside his judgment of their enemies, when his final Messiah comes to Israel. 

That Messiah and Deliverer is Jesus. In Matthew’s Gospel his ministry begins with the announcement of God’s eternal Kingdom of God (Matthew 3:2). And his arrival comes with declarations of both impending justice (Matthew 3:7) and imminent deliverance (Matthew 1:21). 

But Jesus did not cause people’s evil to curve back around, as many expected (John 3:17). Instead, he allowed their evil to turn against him. On the cross, Jesus put himself in the way of our wicked deeds. What should have returned upon our own heads, he allowed to come down on his (1 Peter 2:24). 

The day of the Lord’s judgment and mercy occurred simultaneously on the cross (Romans 3:26). Jesus was judged to show mercy not just for Israel, but for all nations. This is why, after Jesus’ death and resurrection, he sent his disciples out from Jerusalem to Judea and Samaria and the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). They were the first wave of new messiahs sent to extend God’s Kingdom and rule the earth with him. The conquest that began in Joshua and was predicted by Obadiah will be completed by the church today (Ephesians 1:22-23). And one day soon, all evil in the world will be judged, and all God’s people will rule in peace forever. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God whose coming Kingdom brings judgment and mercy. And that you will see Jesus as the Messiah who rules forever with us—his church—by his side."

One day, Jesus will come to destroy oppressors and disarm the violent.",Website,Amos Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

God, like a lion, roars from Jerusalem (Amos 1:2). Amos, a farmer and shepherd, is tasked to take God’s message of judgment from Judah in the south to Israel and its leaders in the north (Amos 7:14-15).

But Amos doesn’t start by listing Israel’s faults. He first condemns the nations surrounding Israel for their inhumanity. The phrase “for three sins … even for four” is repeated seven times. And each time this phrase comes before detailing a particular nation’s fourth and most egregious crime. Syria brutally razed the territory of Gilead (Amos 1:3). The Philistines raided and then trafficked their prisoners to Edom (Amos 1:6). The nation of Tyre conquered and slave-traded a whole nation (Amos 1:9). Edom viciously attacked a brother-country and slaughtered their women (Amos 1:11). The Ammonites ripped children from inside their pregnant mothers (Amos 1:13), and Moab desecrated the grave of their king (Amos 2:1). Amos then turns to his home of Judah and condemns them not simply for being inhuman, but for also breaking God’s laws (Amos 2:4).

Amos condemns every nation that geographically surrounds Israel. Now Israel and her leaders lie in the center of his prophetic crosshairs. He repeats his pattern, but makes sure to list all four of Israel’s egregious sins (Amos 2:6). Israel has sold her own people into slavery over petty debts and oppressed the poor through neglect (Amos 2:6b-7a). Fathers and sons drunkenly abuse the women of Israel on the same cloaks they took from the poor as collateral on their debts (Amos 2:7b-8).

These perversions of both justice and humanity were precisely what God opposed and destroyed when he led them out of slavery in Egypt and into the promised land (Amos 2:9-10). For Israel to go back isn’t just tragic and hypocritical, but a total rejection of the God who saved them. So God promises to make these oppressors weak (Amos 2:14). He will rob the violent of their weapons (Amos 2:15). And the most brazen and bold abusers will run away naked from his righteous anger (Amos 2:16).

Where is the Gospel?

It is good news that God cannot stomach injustice and inhumanity. It is good news that God will bring the full might of his power and the ferocity of his anger against abusers, human-traffickers, and the corrupt.

If you are the victim of injustice or inhumanity, God is on your side. Jesus is coming soon. And He will wage war against evil in all its forms (Revelation 19:11). He will destroy the oppressor and disarm the violent (Colossians 2:15). When Jesus died on the cross he showed us a picture of God’s inevitable justice against evil. The apostle Paul says that if God did not spare his own son, how will he not also give us victory in Jesus over our enemies (Romans 8:32, 37)?

That’s why the book of Revelation pictures Jesus confronting the forces of evil in a robe dipped with blood (Revelation 19:13). It's a symbol not just of the blood Jesus lost on the cross, but an omen of destruction for those who dare harm his own. For most victims, justice is too slow. Too often the wicked get away with it. But Jesus’ cross and his Word promise that he is coming again. No evil will go unpunished and every victim who calls out to him will be vindicated.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who hates injustice and inhumanity. And may you see Jesus as the one who is coming soon to rescue the oppressed and vindicate the victim."

In a series of visions, Amos sees Israel’s destruction play out five times.

The first vision is a plague of locusts (Amos 7:1). After seeing it, Amos asks God for forgiveness and reminds God of how small Israel is (Amos 7:2). Mentioning Israel’s size isn’t just a way to ask for mercy, but a reminder of why God chose Israel as his people in the first place—Israel was the smallest of all the nations (Deuteronomy 7:7). God chose them despite themselves. And because of Amos’ prayers, God relents from the first plague (Amos 7:3).

The second vision is a wildfire eating up the land (Amos 7:4). Amos begs for God to stop and again reminds him of why God chose tiny Israel (Amos 7:5). God again relents (Amos 7:6). But Amos can’t argue with the third vision. God sets up a plumbline, a long string with a weight on the end that keeps a perfectly straight line (Amos 7:7). When compared to the straight line of justice and righteousness, Israel is crooked beyond salvation. God will not just sweep her injustices and idolatry under the rug (Amos 7:8). God will destroy Israel’s false temples and the leaders who built them (Amos 7:9).

The fourth vision is a basket of ripe fruit (Amos 8:1). The point is simple: Israel’s oppression is ripe for devouring (Amos 8:2). And the final vision is of God himself coming down from heaven and shattering the idols, temples, and idolaters of Israel (Amos 9:1). Amos sees that God’s eyes will remain fixed on sinful Israel until she’s wiped from the map (Amos 9:8).

But there’s hope too. The faithful from the family of Jacob, the tiny family God chose from among all others, will be preserved. After God’s judgment, God will rebuild something of Israel’s faithful past from the line of David, a descendant of Jacob (Amos 9:11). God will even invite enemy nations into that new era of peace and prosperity (Amos 9:12). Amos’ final vision then reverses the destruction the previous visions laid out (Amos 9:14). One day God will restore, renew, and make permanent everything Israel lost (Amos 9:15).

Where is the Gospel?

God cannot stomach injustice. Israel’s neglect of the poor and her alignment with false deities must end. But God will also remain true to his promises and commitments. God told Abraham and Jacob that Israel would bless the world (Genesis 12:3; 28:14). He told Moses he didn’t choose Israel because she was strong or righteous, but because she was small (Deuteronomy 7:7). He promised David that his throne would last forever (2 Samuel 7:13). Terrifyingly, Amos warns us that God’s justice must be carried out. But mercifully, so will God’s promises.

Both a descendent of Jacob and David, Jesus, will judge oppression, fulfill God’s promises, bless enemy nations, and renew and restore what Israel lost. On the cross Jesus was measured against the crooked plumbline of Israel’s justice and destroyed as Amos prophesied about Israel’s false temple (John 2:19). Israel’s idolatry and injustice were ripe, but Jesus—as a representative for Israel—died for them (1 Peter 2:24).

Because of Jesus, God’s mercy can now flow from Israel and bless the world. Just as God relented from disaster for Israel, God will relent for any repentant nation despite its injustice (Acts 15:11). In the book of Acts, when some objected to this, the apostle James quotes Amos to prove that all nations have access to God’s promises (Acts 15:18-19). And one day, Jesus promises that he will make all things new (Revelation 21:5). Everything lost will be restored and renewed. Because of Jesus, the faithful son of Jacob and David, God will be true to his promises and we will live forever in a Kingdom of peace and prosperity.

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who hates injustice. And may you see Jesus who mercifully fulfills all God’s promises."

Amos reminds Israel that God rescued her from slavery in Egypt (Amos 3:1), and that God chose Israel’s forefather Abraham to be the agent through whom all people on earth will be blessed (Genesis 12:2-3). Israel bears a unique calling to worship God and love her neighbor—and in doing so bless the world. But Amos declares that Israel has failed her global calling, cursed the world, and will experience the consequences for it (Amos 3:2).

In a series of four speeches, Amos exposes Israel’s injustice, hypocrisy, idolatry, and coming judgment. It’s so bad that Amos tells Israel to gather the brutal nations that surround her and invite them to judge Israel’s violence and crime (Amos 3:9-10). Instead of being sympathetic to Israel’s methods, Amos predicts these evil nations will be disgusted by what they see and wipe them off the map (Amos 3:11; 6:14).

Amos says Israel’s women are like cows who feed off the poor and crush the needy under their weight (Amos 4:1). Israel’s men lie drunk on beds of ivory and refuse to show compassion, even for their brothers (Amos 6:4-6). Israel has forgotten her calling. She’s replaced worship of God and love of neighbor with love of foreign gods and injustice.

The extent to which Israel worships the gods of sex, power, and war from the nations around her is the extent to which she will do violence and oppress those she is meant to protect. Worship and justice go hand-in-hand. So Amos begs Israel to seek God alone and to seek good instead of evil (Amos 5:6, 14). The Israelites’ failure to do justice is evidence that there is no true love of God and their religion is a sham (Amos 5:21).

So Amos begs Israel to let justice roll like waters, and righteousness like a never-failing stream (Amos 5:24). If sin has covered the land like a flood, Israel must restore her calling to flood the earth with worship of God and love of each other. If Israel wants to escape her judgment and fulfill her calling to bless the nations, God must be her only God, and his abundant and consistent justice her only standard.

Where is the Gospel?

Worship and justice go hand-in-hand. Amos could measure the idolatry of Israel by measuring the inequality among her citizens. Alternatively, caring for the poor is a sign of sincere and true faith. Jesus’ brother James said something similar. He said “faith without deeds is useless” and that even Abraham’s faith was proven by his actions (James 2:20, 22).

As Christians, we are now a part of Abraham’s family and Israel’s unique calling to bless the world (Galatians 3:29). Like Israel, we’ve been saved from slavery and set free (Romans 6:7)! And as Jesus said, our mission is summed up in the twin commands of loving God and loving one another (Matthew 22:37-39). As new members of this ancient family, we have inherited a great calling to love and proclaim the good news of Jesus and to enact the love and justice Amos longed to see.

And while the poor will always be with us (Matthew 26:11); and while we wait for a day when Jesus, Abraham’s greatest son, will return and make justice roll like water and flood the world with righteousness, we are left with a warning. Worship of God and true justice go hand-in-hand. And when it doesn’t, as Amos preached, you can be sure whatever is being loved is not God.

But in this warning, there is good news. Warnings are just that, and they imply that justice can rule and reign on the earth if we listen. Injustice is preventable, sincere worship of God is possible, and soon Jesus will return to destroy all injustice. He will flood the world with his blessing.

See For Yourself

The book of Joel is a prophetic poem. While it’s difficult to know precisely when Joel wrote his book, we do know it was written in response to a devastating plague of locusts (Joel 1:2). In increasingly vivid metaphors, much of Joel is spent describing this natural disaster and its aftermath.

The locusts are like lions dismembering grapevines (Joel 1:6-7), and horse-drawn chariots leaping from mountain to mountain (Joel 2:4-5). The devastation is so thorough that temple sacrifices are forced to stop because there is no grain left to offer(Joel 1:9-10). The drunks can’t even find a way to ferment their own booze and quench their addiction (Joel 1:5). Following the locusts, drought and fire shrivel and burn the land (Joel 1:18-19).

But Joel isn’t just describing a natural disaster, he’s using the plague of locusts to point towards an even more terrifying event—“the day of the Lord'' (Joel 1:15, 2:1). Often in the Prophets, “the day of the Lord'' is when God rescues Israel from her enemies, normally in some sort of decisive battle (Zepheniah 1:14). But Joel subverts the assumption of rescue and warns Israel that the locusts are just the first wave of God’s attack 

against

 Israel (Joel 2:11). God will swarm Israel with an enemy army and it will blot out the sun, moon, and stars like the insects darken the sky (Joel 2:10). The day of the Lord will be the day of Israel’s national destruction.

So twice Joel calls on Israel to repent and to lament (Joel 1:13-14, Joel 2:17). A lament is a prayer that describes one’s pain and begs for mercy. And repentance is a wholehearted return to God and his laws. Joel tells Israel they need to rend their hearts, and not just their clothes (Joel 2:13a). It’s Joel’s way of saying God won’t respond to half-hearted ritual or hypocrites, but he will respond in compassion and grace to authentic repentance (Joel 2:13b).

And the locust-haunted Israel listens to Joel. They all gather in the temple and, in genuine repentance, ask God to spare them from the coming day of the Lord so the world might know the love, grace, and power of their God (Joel 2:16-17).

Where is the Gospel?

Natural disasters should make us repent of hypocrisy. And plagues of locusts (and even pandemics) should cause us to lament, not only for the lives lost, but for the pride, hypocrisy, and fake religiosity they expose. The book of Joel invites us to pause at events like tsunamis, forest fires, and tornados and realize they are pictures of how God will ultimately judge our religious hypocrisy. Jesus said himself that earthquakes, famines, and war are simply birth pains of a day of judgment yet to come (Matthew 24:7-8). The book of Joel is a wake-up call. In moments of natural disaster, the hypocritical should lament over the devastation they see. They should repent because they have a clear picture of how their so-called religious performance will be judged by God.

Joel didn’t know if God would respond to Israel’s repentance, but we do (Joel 2:14)

. 

When hypocrites repent and lament there is always forgiveness and mercy in Jesus. In Jesus we have nothing to fear from the coming day of the Lord because the day Jesus died was the day of the Lord that Joel tells us to fear. Every natural disaster points to the day Jesus died. Under the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, and just like Joel predicted, the skies went dark and the earth quaked when Jesus breathed his last (Luke 23:44, Matthew 27:51). On the cross Jesus experienced the judgment hypocrites deserve. Even the worst and most half-hearted can know there is no judgment left for those who lament and repent to Jesus. And now because of Jesus, natural disasters no longer need to remind us of the judgment we will face, but of the judgment that’s been exhausted in Jesus. Eternal mercy is now ours forever.

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see God’s coming day of the Lord. And may you see Jesus as the one who died on the day of the Lord so we will never experience judgment."

Israel has just been devastated by locusts. In the first half of his book, Joel prophesies about a coming day of God’s judgment when Israel will be captured by an invading nation (Joel 2:11). But in the last half of his book, Joel details God’s plans for a future day of the Lord’s 

salvation

. God will undo the devastation caused by the locusts (Joel 2:25). He’ll feed the livestock that starved in the drought (Joel 2:22). He’ll water the cracked land and stockpile their barns till they burst (Joel 2:23-24). But most importantly, God promises to restore his relationship with Israel and restore her stolen land (Joel 2:26-27).

Since Eden, God has planned to live with his people. That’s why God walked in the garden, that’s why he led Israel by a pillar of fire, and that’s why Israel had a temple. And that’s why on the day of the Lord’s mercy, Joel says God will pour out himself—his Spirit—on all Israel’s citizens (Joel 2:28). In the Old Testament, God’s Spirit only fell on its leaders and prophets. But on this coming day of the Lord’s salvation, the gift of the Spirit will be given to the lowly and ordinary (Joel 2:29). Children and servants will be given the gifts of vision and prophecy once reserved for kings. On that day the whole cosmos will shake and the sun will darken not as harbingers of doom but as portents of mercy (Joel 2:30-31). And on that day of the Lord, all who call on his name will be saved (Joel 2:32).

And once their relationship is restored on this new day of the Lord’s salvation, the land stolen from Israel will be restored (Joel 3:1). God will soon gather up Israel’s oppressors, slave masters, and enemies into a valley called “Valley of Decision” or “God has Judged” (Joel 3:2, 14). And in that valley, God will judge Israel’s invaders and Israel will be restored to her ancestral lands (Joel 3:15-16). God will then remake the land into something like the garden of Eden. Mountains will drip wine, hills will flow with rivers of milk, and clear streams will water the land (Joel 3:18). On the day of the Lord’s salvation, everything wrong will be made right. Israel, as a nation, will be restored.

Where is the Gospel?

All the prophecies Joel describes have already or will soon come true through Jesus. Fifty days after Jesus died, God poured out his Spirit (Acts 2:1-4a). And the apostle Peter said it was to fulfill Joel’s prophecy (Acts 2:16-17)! On the day of Pentecost, women, children, and servants are all filled with the Holy Spirit. Fire, like the kind that led Israel, rests on them (Acts 2:3). Pentecost is proof that God’s relationship with his people is restored!

But significantly, the coming of the Spirit is not limited to Israel. All nations that call on God’s name will be saved (Acts 2:21). And one of the first acts of the Spirit is for people filled with God’s Spirit to proclaim the day of God’s salvation in as many languages as are present (Acts 2:4). On the day of Pentecost 3,000 people from all over the earth became the first citizens of a new Eden (Acts 2:9, 41).

And God is not yet done pouring out his Spirit and inviting new citizens into a restored and global Israel. There is a day of the Lord coming when God will gather up all the world’s oppressors, slave masters, and enemies into a new valley where God will judge (Revelation 16:16). And in that valley, God will destroy his people’s enemies. He will restore not just the land of Israel, but the whole earth back to Eden. On that day of the Lord, the globe will be remade and we will live with God once again (Revelation 21:1). And on that day a river will flow from the mountain of God, not just for our own enjoyment but for the healing and salvation of all nations (Revelation 22:2).

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see God as both just and merciful. And may you see Jesus’ death as the day of the Lord which promises that all who call on his name will be saved."

Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, dreams of a giant statue destroyed by a meteor falling from the sky (Daniel 2:31, 34). He’s both troubled by the imagery and paranoid that if he tells his advisors what he saw, they will explain it away (Daniel 2:1, 9). So he demands that his counselors both 

reveal 

and 

interpret

 a dream he refuses to tell them (Daniel 2:2-3). Not only that, he will kill them all if they fail (Daniel 2:5). These counselors are the wisest men in Babylon, but none of them are wise enough to reveal the mystery of the king’s dream (Daniel 2:10). They’re forced to admit only the gods can do what the king asks, and remind Nebuchadnezzar that the gods don’t live among humans (Daniel 2:11).

Irrationally angry, Nebuchadnezzar orders all of the wise men executed, which includes the faithful Jewish exile, Daniel (Daniel 2:12). But as they come to execute Daniel, he responds with wisdom (Daniel 2:14). He says he can do what Nebuchadnezzar’s wise men couldn’t (Daniel 2:16). Daniel then prays to the God who lives in heaven. God reveals to Daniel the mystery of the king’s dream and its interpretation (Daniel 2:18-19).

Daniel praises the God who does not live among humans for revealing this mystery to him. He heads to see the king (Daniel 2:22). Daniel tells Nebuchadnezzar that his wise men failed because they cannot speak to the God of heaven (Daniel 2:27-28). But through Daniel, the God of heaven will speak to Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel accurately reports the king’s dream back to him and explains the meaning of the giant statue destroyed by the meteor. The statue represents a succession of world kingdoms that are eventually destroyed by the Kingdom of the God of heaven (Daniel 2:44).

But instead of acknowledging God and his wisdom, Nebuchadnezzar bows down to Daniel and promotes him (Daniel 2:46, 48). To his credit, Nebuchadnezzar says Daniel’s God is “God of gods and the Lord of kings.” Still, he does not believe it (Daniel 2:47). In the very next chapter, Nebuchadnezzar ignores Daniel’s warning and builds a statue just like the one he dreamed of to celebrate his own wisdom and power (Daniel 3:1).

Where is the Gospel?

Nebuchadnezzar’s dream finally came true when Jesus left the heavens, came to earth, and established a Kingdom not of this world (John 18:36). Jesus is the meteor of Nebuchadnezzar’s vision that comes to destroy the empires of the world. The most powerful kingdom is no longer the next in a long line of successive empires that proudly celebrate their own power. The most powerful kingdom is the Kingdom of Jesus. And the moment Jesus humbly gave up his power on the cross is the moment the meteor smashed the proud empires of the world.

Daniel chapter 2 isn’t just about competing empires, but competing wisdoms: the wisdom of Babylon vs. the wisdom of God. Confident in the wisdom of Babylon, none of Nebuchadnezzar’s wisest men could reveal the king’s mystery—and they almost died with their wisdom. But Daniel, confident in the wisdom of the God who does not live with man, saved not only himself but all the wise men from execution. When Daniel trusted the wisdom of God, he revealed the mystery of the king’s dream and gave life to those cursed to certain death.

The same is true with Jesus. Like Nebuchadnezzar, God also has had a mysterious dream about the fate of empires and the Kingdom of God. God’s dream is that all people from all nations will be saved from certain death (Ephesians 3:9). And the mystery of God’s dream for the world comes true on the cross. Jesus saves adherents of all other wisdoms from death and grants them access into a new global Kingdom (Ephesians 3:6). Normally, when new empires take over, a consolidation of power bars citizenship from any but the most loyal. But this is not so in the Kingdom of Heaven. When the meteor of God’s Kingdom comes, he smashes the old borders and freely offers salvation, life from the dead, and wisdom to all who trust the God who does not dwell with man.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God’s wisdom. And may you see Jesus as God’s wisdom in the flesh who reveals the mystery that all who trust in him will be saved."

Israel is experiencing a golden age under the evil king Jeroboam (Hosea 1:1). But God used this king to save Israel from their enemies, restore their borders, and strengthen their economy (2 Kings 14:27). Heartbreakingly, even though God cared for his people like a good husband, they gave their loyalty to false gods from foreign countries, crediting them for their success. That’s why God refers to his people throughout Hosea as an adulterous wife—or more honestly, a whore.

In response to Israel’s spiritual adultery, God raises up a prophet named Hosea. He tells Hosea to marry a promiscuous and adulterous woman named Gomer and have children with her (Hosea 1:2). His marriage is a prophetic mirror—a living picture—of God’s relationship with Israel. God, like Hosea, is the faithful husband. Israel, like Gomer, is the adulterous wife. But this living picture doesn’t stop with the marriage. It extends to the children Hosea has with Gomer. They have three children and each is given a symbolic name meant as a sign of God’s rejection of Israel.

The first child is called Jezreel (Hosea 1:4). Jezreel was a region synonymous with death. It had long been a place of political bloodshed, where kings and queens were assassinated (2 Kings 10:11). Hosea’s first child told Israel that he was about to put an end to king Jeroboam's line by making them a place of bloodshed like Jezreel (Hosea 1:5).

Hosea’s second child is named “no mercy” or “not loved” (Hosea 1:6). Her name signals a grim warning that God will no longer be merciful or show saving acts of love toward Israel. Hosea’s third child is given perhaps the most pointed name—”not my people” (Hosea 1:9). Israel will no longer be God’s people and he will not be their God. The names of Hosea’s children prophesy that God will destroy Israel without mercy because he is no longer their God.

But right after this shocking proclamation, God promises to be merciful once again. He will not ultimately exterminate his people, but will multiply them as he swore to their ancestors. He will call them his people again (Hosea 1:10). This will happen when God appoints one leader to unite his people and bring them out of Jezreel, turning a place of death into a place of salvation (Hosea 1:11).

Where is the Gospel?

This leader Hosea spoke of is Jesus. He is the one who takes those who are not his people, and makes them his people (1 Peter 2:10). He is the one who takes those who need mercy and lavishes them with it. Jesus is the one who comes to our places of death and brings life.

Jesus does this by fulfilling the marriage prefigured in Hosea and Gomer. Jesus called himself Israel’s groom (Matthew 9:15). Though she was promiscuous and adulterous, Jesus proved that his love for Israel had persevered by showing mercy to the promiscuous and adulterers in his ministry (Luke 7:37). Jesus was faithful to his people when they were faithless toward him, even when they put him to death.

Like Hosea, Jesus’ ministry is also a living mirror. It shows us that we are the whores who need saving. We have given our hearts to providers other than God, so we deserve to inherit the names of Gomer’s children—Unloved, Unclaimed, and Place of Death.

But just as God vowed to make Israel’s king like Jezreel, heaven’s king went from the cross to the grave. Jesus turned a place of death into a place of salvation by dying the death his bride earned. And because our husband died in our place we can be called God’s people once again. We can become beloved children of God.

The only hope for spiritual prostitutes like us is for a good husband to come and marry us (Revelation 21:2). Jesus has married an adulterous bride and is turning her into a spotless and loved wife (Ephesians 5:27).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who loves his people like a husband loves his wife. And may you see Jesus as our ultimate husband, who died to make adulterers like us his own."

Nebuchadnezzar has a confusing and alarming dream. He dreams of a great tree that shades the earth but is chopped down at the command of an angel (Daniel 4:11, 14). The stump is bound in chains, and then the stump goes insane and acts like an animal for seven seasons (Daniel 4:15). The angel then interprets the image of this tree turned stump, turned animal. It means God alone rules the kingdoms of men. God gives power to the kings of the earth. And God has decided to give authority to the humble, not the proud (Daniel 4:17).

Daniel warns Nebuchadnezzar that he is the tree in danger of being chopped down (Daniel 4:22). He has grown proud in his power. Soon he will become more like an animal than a man and spend seven years dethroned and humiliated (Daniel 4:25). Nebuchadnezzar must repent, do justice, and acknowledge God is the only God of the world (Daniel 4:26).

But a whole year passes, and Nebuchadnezzar does nothing to change (Daniel 4:29). Forgetting his dream, he goes onto his balcony and brags: “Is not this the great Babylon 

I

 have built as the royal residence, by 

my

 mighty power and for the glory of 

my

 majesty

?

” (Daniel 4:30). Immediately, Nebuchadnezzar goes insane and becomes the animal Daniel prophesied (Daniel 4:31). He eats grass and grows hair like feathers and fingernails like talons (Daniel 4:33).

But just as Daniel warned, after seven periods of madness, God returns Nebuchadnezzar’s sanity (Daniel 4:34). Nebuchadnezzar finally humbles himself before the God of Daniel. God raises him up not only back to his throne but to an increased level of power and greatness (Daniel 4:36). Nebuchadnezzar then warns his kingdom that “everything [God] does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble” (Daniel 4:37).

Where is the Gospel?

This is the end of Nebuchadnezzar’s story. The king who praised himself and boasted about his kingdom has been humbled. Nebuchadnezzar finally admits that only one Kingdom will last forever—God’s. In every other story, Nebuchadnezzar’s pride is humbled as he’s forced to admit the supremacy of Daniel’s God—and then Daniel or his friends are promoted to higher positions of power (Daniel 2:48). But here, Nebuchadnezzar is raised above his madness and restored to his throne and rule over Babylon (Daniel 4:36).

Throughout the Bible, humility is the key to being in relationship with God (Proverbs 3:34; James 4:10). But Nebuchadnezzar also shows us that no pride is too monstrous to disqualify us from receiving the grace of God. This is the same king who refused God’s warnings, built a 90-foot statue to his vanity, forced others to bow to his image, and burnt those who refused. But Nebuchadnezzar shows us those who humble themselves will be lifted up by God.

God is so committed to this that he follows the same pattern for himself. God in Jesus humbled himself. He didn’t consider the wealth and power of heaven as a reason to gloat over his people (Philippians 2:6). To his family, Jesus was just as crazy as Nebuchadnezzar (Mark 3:21). The apostle Paul calls the tree that humbled Jesus “foolishness” (1 Corinthians 1:18). And like Nebuchadnezzar, Jesus became like an animal, a sacrificial lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7). But God lifted him up from his slaughter and gave him more authority than Nebuchadnezzar could ever have dreamed (Philippians 2:9-10). And because of Jesus, anyone can relive the story of Nebuchadnezzar and Jesus. Those who humble themselves like Nebuchadnezzar will be exalted like Jesus (Ephesians 1:19).

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who humbles the proud. And may you see Jesus as the one who lifts you up."

God chose Israel to establish his Kingdom of justice, purity, and goodness on Earth. And he promised that as long as Israel remained committed to him, he would live in Israel’s temple and ensure his good purposes were done on the earth. But in Ezekiel’s first vision, God was not in Jerusalem’s temple, where everyone expected him to be, but in Babylon (Ezekiel 1:3). Now, in a new vision, God explains why he left. God has left his home in Jerusalem because it is full of evil and idolatry, and before he can live among his people again, he must purify it.

In this second vision, Ezekiel is given a prophetic view of what’s happening inside Jerusalem’s temple. The first thing he sees is a foreign idol standing before the northern gate to God’s temple (Ezekiel 8:1-6). God’s first command to his people was to make no idols, but now there is a carved monument to Israel’s rejection of God right outside his house (Exodus 20:3-4). But God shows Ezekiel that there are even more horrors hidden inside his home. Behind a wall, 70 of Israel’s leaders offer secret prayers to images of insects and snakes (Ezekiel 8:9-11). Deeper still, Ezekiel sees Israelite daughters worshiping the fertility god Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14-15). Finally, in the heart of the temple are 25 of Israel’s leaders who now worship the rising sun rather than the one who made it (Ezekiel 8:16). God also reveals that Jerusalem is not only idolatrous, but its leaders also maintain their power through murder, and writing unjust laws in their favor (Ezekiel 8:17; 9:9; 11:1-3). All of this evil and defilement is not fit to house God’s good and clean presence. So God has left the temple and cleanse it through destruction (Ezekiel 8:17).

In a vision, God calls six warriors and a priest with an inkwell to stand before the temple (Ezekiel 9:1-2). God tells the priest to mark the foreheads of anyone who publicly opposes Israel’s increasing idolatry and depravity (Ezekiel 9:3-4). The warriors cannot harm those with the mark of the priest, but all others will be killed (Ezekiel 9:5-7). The pollution their evil has caused must be stopped. But as Ezekiel watches God’s executioners, he asks if anyone will be spared from his cleansing. God’s only response is that Israel’s idolatry, murder, and corruption are so bad that it would be unjust not to put an end to it (Ezekiel 9:8-10). God then calls the priest to collect coals from underneath his throne and burn the city down (Ezekiel 10:1-2). As he does so, God’s throne slowly moves away from its position over the center of his temple and towards its outer walls. God is leaving his temple to lay siege against it and the leaders who’ve corrupted it (Ezekiel 10:3-22).

Ezekiel then takes an active role in the vision and condemns the leaders worshiping the rising sun. As he speaks, the chief leader falls dead. Horrified, Ezekiel asks again if anyone will be spared from God’s cleansing (Ezekiel 11:13). But this time, God says, “Yes.” He will gather those marked by the priest and restore them to their land (Ezekiel 11:14-17). And when they do, he will transform his people’s hearts by his Spirit to love him and keep his laws as long as they live (Ezekiel 11:18-20). The vision ends with a temple in ruins for its evil and idolatry and God’s cosmic throne, leaving Jerusalem to rest on mountains far to the east (Ezekiel 11:21-25). 

Where is the Gospel?

There is a small glimmer of hope in God’s destruction of Jerusalem. Through destruction, God promises to purify and entirely transform a small group of people. These people will no longer be hardened against God but softened by God’s Spirit to listen and love God with their whole hearts (Ezekiel 11:18-20). Ezekiel might have assumed this transformed heart would happen immediately after Jerusalem’s temple was destroyed, but this was not the case. The softened heart Ezekiel prophesied about wasn’t given to God’s people until a new prophet named Jesus came to Israel and announced the temple’s destruction once again. 

Like Ezekiel in his vision, Jesus stood in Jerusalem’s temple, condemned the idolatry he found there, and denounced its leaders’ injustice (Matthew 21:12-13; Mark 12:38-40; Luke 19:45-48). Like Ezekiel, Jesus prophesied that the temple would be destroyed (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6). And for these prophecies against the corrupt religious establishment, Jesus was murdered. But when Jesus died, the curtain that concealed God’s throne was torn in half. It symbolized that God had left his corrupt temple behind for good (Matthew 27:51). When Jesus died, God showed that he had left the temple and was prepared to destroy it. Only 40 years later, it was destroyed by Rome, and it has never been rebuilt.

But Jesus did not only come to prophesy God’s cleansing; he came to transform his people by cleaning them (John 3:17). When Jesus was destroyed, his death cleansed us from our defilement, just as Israel’s destruction purified God’s people (1 John 2:2). More than that, Jesus rose from his destruction. He entered God’s cosmic throne room and, like the priest with the inkwell, began marking and sealing his people with his Spirit (Ephesians 1:13). Like Ezekiel hoped, everyone who believes Jesus’ prophecies is cleansed through his sacrifice and is entirely transformed. You might look inside yourself and see an ugly and corrupted “temple.” You might worry that if God saw it, he would destroy you like he destroyed Israel’s temple. But Jesus died to clean you. If you believe in his death and resurrection, he will mark you as his own. He will save you, and nothing will prevent God from transforming the people he has died to mark.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who softens hearts. And may you see Jesus as the one who was destroyed to cleanse and transform us. "

The prophet Ezekiel delivers two prophecies explaining why God is about to annul the covenant treaty they made with him long ago. At their nation’s founding, they, like a bride-to-be, promised to love God and obey his laws on top of Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:7). God promised that he, like a good husband, would be faithful to provide, protect, and bless them. However, throughout Israel’s history, its kings and leaders turned the people away from the marriage covenant they made with God and toward false lovers known as idols. Since Israel broke their covenant with God, Ezekiel says God has removed his blessing and protection, and a foreign nation will soon root out all idolaters from Israel and destroy the false idols they’ve built.

Ezekiel’s first prophecy is against the mountain shrines, where people built altars and made rival covenants with foreign gods (Ezekiel 6:1-3). For rejecting the covenant he made with them on a mountain, God warns that these hilltop altars will crumble, and those who loved its idols will topple and lie dead beside the lifeless gods they made (Ezekiel 6:4-7,13-14). The few who escape destruction will face exile. But there, in exile, they will remember God as a broken-hearted lover who rightly fought for the devotion of his covenant bride (Ezekiel 6:8-10).

In Ezekiel’s second prophecy, God tells Israel their whole land is contaminated with idolatry. There is no part of God’s nation that has not been touched by the evil and bloody practices of their foreign gods. Instead of providing, protecting, and blessing his people, he will end all their evil and cleanse the land of its abominations through disaster after disaster (Ezekiel 7:1-9). Sword, plague, and famine will cleanse not only their shrines but will destroy the adulterous people in Israel (Ezekiel 7:15). Israel’s economy will collapse, the people will be either slaughtered or taken captive, and their property will be seized (Ezekiel 7:10-19). While some will survive God’s judgment, the destruction will be total (Ezekiel 7:16-20). And no one in Israel will be able to stop it (Ezekiel 7:23-27).

Where is the Gospel?

Israel’s adulterous idolatry broke the marriage covenant God made with them at their nation’s founding. But even though Israel abandoned their husband, God did not abandon his bride or his promises to provide, protect, and bless his people. Despite his people’s faithlessness to their end of the covenant, he would be faithful to his. In the person of Jesus, he would faithfully provide, protect, and bless his people by providing a new covenant for them.

The night before he died, Jesus told his disciples that his broken body and spilled blood would begin a new covenant with God (Luke 22:20). In it, God’s relationship with his people would be based on new terms. Like before, God would be faithful to his people and protect them, but unlike before, God would cleanse his faithless and adulterous people into a faithful and committed bride. In Israel’s first covenant with God, no idol, king, prophet, or priest could cleanse Israel’s hearts and turn them from their adulterous ways. But in the new covenant, Jesus cleanses our defiled hearts with his blood and changes us into faithful lovers through his Spirit. 

This new covenant will never be broken and will last forever. That’s because Jesus not only died to secure it but also rose from the dead to keep it forever. Jesus’ new covenant blessings and protections will last eternally.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is faithful to his covenant even when his people are not. And may you see Jesus as the one who died to secure a new covenant of love for God’s people."

Jesus is the final Ezekiel, who has come to bring life to his people.",Website,Ezekiel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The nation that God once chose to bring life to the world is dying. Israel is under the control of Babylon, and it seems like there is little hope of becoming the people they are meant to be. But one day, while a man named Ezekiel sits on the bank of a canal, the sky opens. Ezekiel sees a vision of the Creator God, and he commissions Ezekiel to be his prophet to dying Israel (Ezekiel 1:1-3). 

Almost everything Ezekiel sees in his vision is meant to remind the exiles that the God who created the world can recreate them, even after their world is destroyed. At first, Ezekiel sees a windy storm so filled with lightning that the clouds look like they are on fire (Ezekiel 1:4). The wind is reminiscent of God’s “wind” or “Spirit” hovering over the waters of the ancient earth (Genesis 1:2; Ezekiel 1:3-4). The stormy light that dawns over the Babylonian wilderness is like the light God shone over the chaos before creation (Genesis 1:3; Ezekiel 1:4). The first images tell us Ezekiel is seeing the God who created the world. But inside the storm are four beings with wings (Ezekiel 1:5-9). Each being has four faces; one is human, another a lion, another an ox, and the last an eagle. The beings represent how the whole created order (humanity, wild beasts, tamed animals, and flying creatures) is ruled by God. Each being is connected to two wheels nestled inside one another, and the wheels are covered in eyes (Ezekiel 1:10-21). The eyes symbolize that God sees everything on the earth he created, and the omnidirectional wheels tell us that God can go wherever he wants. Finally, Ezekiel sees that the beings support the sky, and above the sky is a fiery king seated on a throne surrounded by light (Ezekiel 1:22-27). The fiery king is God seated in power above the skies and ruling the earth. Ezekiel’s vision is hopeful. Despite Israel’s exile, the God of creation stands ready to give new life to his people. 

As a symbol of this new life, Ezekiel faints after seeing a vision of the God of Creation (Ezekiel 1:28). But God raises Ezekiel’s body from the dust, just as he raised Adam from the ground. God even calls him “son of adam” (although your Bible might translate it as “son of man”) and commissions him as his prophet of new creation to his dying people (Ezekiel 2:1-4). Despite opposition, God says Ezekiel must faithfully speak his words (Ezekiel 2:5-7). Suddenly, a scroll containing God’s message to Israel is handed to Ezekiel, and he eats it. It’s a sign that he is willing to be God’s prophet (Ezekiel 2:8-3:3). God then encourages Ezekiel that he will first make him stronger than the opposition he will face (Ezekiel 3:4-11). Suddenly, Ezekiel is back at the canal and spends the next seven days nearly dead (Ezekiel 3:12-15). But God breathes new life into Ezekiel's nearly dead body and tells him to begin his mission. Just as a watchman warns of coming danger to preserve the lives he watches over, Ezekiel’s warnings, if listened to, will secure the new life God wants to give his people (Ezekiel 3:16-23). With this warning, God tells Ezekiel to go home and wait for his first message (Ezekiel 3:24-27). 

Where is the Gospel?

Ezekiel’s vision of God’s creative and life-giving power was meant to encourage an Israel dying in exile to listen to Ezekiel and experience God’s creative power that would raise their dead nation from exile. Sadly, very few in Israel listened to Ezekiel. As a result, Israel’s capital never recovered. For hundreds of years, God’s people were held captive by different nations until God sent a new prophet to dying Israel, named Jesus. Like God commissioned Ezekiel on the banks of a canal, God commissions Jesus by opening the skies above a river (Luke 3:21-22). A winged being descends as a voice from heaven announces that this Son of Man is God’s chosen prophet to bring new life to a dying people (Luke 3:38). And where Ezekiel ate a scroll to accept God’s mission, Jesus begins his mission by reading from a scroll and announcing the good news that God’s designs for new creation had finally come true (Luke 4:16-20). Jesus is the ultimate prophet of new creation. Jesus is the final Ezekiel, who has come to bring life to his people.

But where Ezekiel prophesied about the coming death and exile headed towards Israel and the protection they would have if they listened, Jesus prophesied about his death and the resurrection life he and his followers would have after it (Mark 8:31-33; 9:30-32; 10:32-34). Ezekiel was a watchman of national destruction, but Jesus was a prophet of his own death. Jesus taught that if people would accept his message of new creation, God’s people would be recreated by God (2 Corinthians 5:17). Jesus promised that if his people would accept his message, they would live forever (John 3:16). And Jesus didn’t just teach this, he did it. Jesus died, but he rose from the dead, too. And if we believe in Jesus’ death and resurrection, we too will escape death and live forever with him.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who rules over all creation. And may you see Jesus as the one who has completed Ezekiel’s mission of new creation. "

God is in the middle of showing the prophet Ezekiel a vision of God’s people returning to their homeland after a long exile. An angel has just given Ezekiel a tour of a new temple in Jerusalem. But as Ezekiel is escorted out of the building, he notices a trickle of water coming from under the temple and flowing east into the desert (Ezekiel 47:1-3). The farther the river runs, the deeper the water gets until it reaches the Dead Sea (Ezekiel 47:4-8). The water from the temple transforms the salty sea into a freshwater ocean. Thanks to the waters from God’s temple, the desert is healed. A dead sea becomes fertile fishing grounds for all God’s people, and a barren desert becomes a jungle of fruit trees that never stop bearing fruit (Ezekiel 47:9-12). This vision symbolizes that God intends his Kingdom to be a place of healing and life for all who worship him.

Immediately after the river heals the land, God describes in great detail the national borders of this restored Israel. Something very similar happens in the book of Numbers when Israel prepares to cross the Jordan River into the land of Canaan for the first time (Numbers 34:1-10; Ezekiel 47:13-20). But in Ezekiel’s vision of this restored Israel, both native Israelites and foreigners, asylum seekers, and refugees can all lay claim to God’s land (Ezekiel 47:21-23). This healed Israel is not just for Israelites but all who look to God and his Kingdom as their true homeland.

Ezekiel then outlines new tribal boundaries for the citizens of Israel’s twelve tribes, emphasizing the equality of God’s people (Ezekiel 48:1-7, 23-29). Each tribe gets an equitable share of land centered around a new capital city, which has God’s new temple and his life-giving river at its center (Ezekiel 48:8-22). Then, to emphasize that all of God’s people have shared access to this holy place, Ezekiel describes the gates of God’s city. For security reasons, ancient cities normally had only one gate, but God’s new capital has twelve—one for each of Israel’s tribes (Ezekiel 48:30-34). Every tribe has free and equal access to God. While many would have expected this city to be a rebuilt Jerusalem, Ezekiel gives this place a different name: his name for this welcoming, safe, equitable, and life-giving city is “The Lord is There” (Ezekiel 48:35b).

Where is the Gospel?

Israel’s homeland has been destroyed. Israel’s citizens have been removed from their ancestral lands. Israel’s capital and temple are in ruins. But God gave Ezekiel a vision in which Israel’s home is restored, their ancestral lands are returned, and a new capital and temple are founded. Ultimately, the Apostle John believed the new temple, the river of life, and the restored kingdom all begin to come true for God’s people in the person of Jesus. 

In John’s account of Jesus’ life, Jesus' ministry begins and ends with water. Jesus’ first miracle is to turn water into wine as a sign of the joy and restoration he would bring (John 2:1-12). Immediately after this, Jesus declares that his body is the final temple of God’s people (John 2:13-19). Like the temple that was destroyed by Babylon, Jesus says his body will be destroyed. But Jesus also says that he will rise from the dead and be rebuilt like the temple in Ezekiel’s vision and give life to his people. Only a few verses later, Jesus tells a foreign woman that the life he intends to give is not just for native Israelites but a refreshing water that all people can drink (John 4:1-26). This water for all people is finally given the moment Jesus dies. John is the only biographer of Jesus to mention that when a spear is thrust into Jesus’ side, water comes rushing out (John 19:34). But just as Jesus said, he rose from the dead. Jesus is the temple, destroyed and rebuilt, from whom rivers of living water flow to heal anyone who worships him. 

In the book of Revelation, John describes in more detail the restoration of God’s people. An angel shows John the eternal capital of God’s people. As in Ezekiel’s vision, it has twelve open gates where all weary people can enter into their new homeland (Revelation 21:10-14). At the center of the city is not a temple but Jesus on his throne (Revelation 21:22). And from under Jesus’ eternal throne is a river with trees on both banks that never stop bearing fruit. And anybody who eats them is healed (Revelation 22:1-5). The story of God’s people ends with the sick being healed, the weary finding rest, and the exiles finding their true home. Jesus has died and risen to give us hope and a guarantee that this Kingdom is coming.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who will restore his people. And may you see Jesus as the one who is our living water. "

Israel’s priests were meant to purify and secure forgiveness for God’s people. But under their leadership, Israel became contaminated with evil, injustice, and violence (Ezekiel 8-11). But God is in the middle of showing the prophet Ezekiel a vision of a new and purified temple where forgiveness and cleansing can be secured once again. Ezekiel has already seen visions of the temple itself (Ezekiel 40-43:12). And now Ezekiel is shown instructions for God’s altar followed by instructions for God’s priests. God’s priests were the ones responsible for carrying out sacrifices on the altar, and the altar was where God’s people could be cleaned of their past sins and be forgiven. The fact that Ezekiel sees both the priesthood and the altar restored is a sign. Despite their past sins, God still desires to cleanse, forgive, and love his people.

Even the details about the altar communicate God’s desire to be in a renewed relationship with his people. For example, the altar is exactly seven cubits high. It’s the same number of days in creation and symbolizes a new beginning to God’s relationship with his people (Ezekiel 44:13-17). However, the altar needs to be cleaned just as the people do. So, Ezekiel is given detailed commands for a special “decontamination” ceremony (Ezekiel 44:18-27). God promises that once the altar has been cleansed, God will be with his people again, and their new relationship can begin.

God then describes a similar cleansing of God’s priests. Ezekiel reminds Israel of the injustice, violence, and idolatry Israel’s religious leaders were guilty of (Ezekiel 44:5-8). And God promises that he will purify the priesthood. Only just, gentle, and faithful priests will serve in his holy place (Ezekiel 44:15-16). Surprisingly, even those once guilty of polluting and contaminating God’s temple can be forgiven and serve God’s temple and people again (Ezekiel 44:9-14). These visions are promises that God will cleanse the priesthood of evil and that soon, God’s priests will obey his commands and lead God’s people in perfect justice and equity (Ezekiel 44:19-31; 45:9-12).

Ezekiel then describes the allotment of land on which the temple, priests, and Israel’s king will live (Ezekiel 45:1-7). In the past, Israel’s religious and political leaders stole property from their fellow citizens and subjects. But this new allotment is a promise that those evil desires will be cleansed from Israel’s leadership. No ruler will ever defraud or rob those under him again (Ezekiel 45:8). Instead, Israel’s leaders will be content with the land God has given them and use their wealth and power to host feasts and provide sacrifices in God’s honor (Ezekiel 45:9-46:18). Ezekiel even mentions the sacred kitchens where God’s priests will prepare meals to serve God’s people rather than themselves (Ezekiel 46:19-24). This section of Ezekiel’s vision ends with the hope that once God transforms Israel’s priesthood and leadership, nothing can get in the way of God and his people living in a relationship of love and forgiveness forever. 

Where is the Gospel?

These prophecies about a restored relationship with God were recorded 25 years into Ezekiel’s 70-year exile in Babylon. Ezekiel records these prophecies because, despite their current punishment, God wants to forgive and live with his people in a land washed clean of evil. Ezekiel’s prophecy finally came true when God lived among his evil people in the person of Jesus. In love, Jesus became the altar, priest, and sacrifice who would cleanse and forgive his people.

The book of Hebrews tells us that Jesus is our altar (Hebrews 13:10). He is the place where sin is cleansed, forgiveness is secured, and a new beginning to our relationship with God begins. The book of Hebrews also tells us that Jesus is our perfect priest (Hebrews 7:1-28). His priesthood is marked by justice, peace, and the power to guarantee an eternal relationship of love with God. The sacrifice that Jesus, the priest, offers is not an animal but his own body (Hebrews 10:1-10). Throughout Israel’s history, animal sacrifices were never able to permanently take away the evil and sin that plagued God’s people and leaders. But when Jesus offered his own body, he transformed and made pure everyone who trusts his sacrifice on their behalf. The altar, priesthood, and sacrifices that Ezekiel saw in his vision all become true in Jesus.

Long ago, God chose Israel as the nation through which the entire world would experience the blessing and life-giving power of God. As Israel listened to their God and obeyed his laws, the entire world would flock to Israel in the hope of justice and a home with their Creator. But Israel has rejected God, his laws, and their calling in the world (Ezekiel 5:5-9). So God tells the prophet Ezekiel to publicly act out a series of prophecies that detail how Jerusalem will be besieged and exiled for her abdication and wickedness. First, Ezekiel sketches a map of Jerusalem on a brick. Then he attacks it with tiny models of siege ramps, battering rams, and enemy camps (Ezekiel 4:1-2). This miniature warfare symbolizes how foreign armies will besiege the real city. Ezekiel then puts an iron pan between him and the besieged brick drawing (Ezekiel 4:3). It represents the iron wall of impenetrable forces that will soon array themselves against Israel.

Then, in a more startling demonstration, Ezekiel is tied up with ropes and lies on his left side for 390 days (Ezekiel 4:4-5). He then turns over and lies on his right side for 40 days (Ezekiel 4:6-8). These numbers of days point to the forty years of grumbling in the desert and the nearly four centuries of idolatry in northern Israel while God’s temple stood in Jerusalem. Ezekiel then dramatizes the suffering his people will face during Jerusalem’s siege. He slowly starves himself on minimal rations of bread and water (Ezekiel 4:4-15). Just as Ezekiel is tied by his ropes, Jerusalem’s inhabitants will be trapped in their city and starve during the coming Babylonian siege (Ezekiel 4:16-17).

After acting out the siege, Ezekiel acts out his people’s subsequent exile. He cuts off his hair and beard with a sword. Then he burns, strikes, scatters, and tucks away some of the hair in his coat (Ezekiel 5:1-4). The brutal end of Ezekiel’s facial hair symbolizes that Jerusalem and its citizens will soon be burned, struck, and scattered abroad in exile. Through these prophetic actions, Ezekiel has been reduced to an emaciated, crudely shaven heap. Ezekiel symbolically bore the destruction and exile of his people in his suffering body. Since Israel has rejected God, his laws, and their calling, Jerusalem will be destroyed, and its citizens will be besieged and carted off into exile (Ezekiel 5:10-17). 

Where is the Gospel?

Sadly, Ezekiel’s symbolic demonstrations of siege and exile did not cause Israel’s people to pick up their calling or repent of their evil. The prophet’s suffering could only prophesy Jerusalem’s destruction, but it could not save his people from it. But God would send another prophet who would not merely symbolically bear his people’s coming destruction and exile but would bear it away. This prophet is none other than God himself, namely, Jesus.

Jesus came prophesying a new destruction and that he would be destroyed and exiled on behalf of his people. Much like Ezekiel was reduced to a shell of himself in acting out Jerusalem’s siege, Jesus was reduced to a beaten and bloodied heap by Roman soldiers. They nailed him to a cross where he bore his people’s destruction and exile on his body (Mark 15:17-19, 24). But unlike Ezekiel, Jesus’ suffering was not a harbinger of a national disaster but a sign of the coming destruction of the evil that caused Israel to reject God and his laws in the first place. Ezekiel’s suffering meant destruction was coming for his people, but Jesus’ suffering meant that the evil that resided in his people’s hearts was destroyed (2 Corinthians 5:21). Jesus’ prophetic work did not end in death. He rose from the grave, and in rising, Jesus’ body prophesied a new future for his people. We can now become a people through which the entire world will experience the blessing and resurrection power of God. Jesus suffered the destruction and exile that comes from our evil once and for all (1 Peter 3:18). There is no destruction for those who repent and trust the life and message of God's ultimate prophet.

Israel was meant to be a fruitful vine that would feed the world, but she has become a withered stalk, filling the world with death. So Ezekiel poses a riddle to the people of Israel to help them see that God has buried them in their death but will raise them to finally bear the fruit of life. Using ancient images associated with Israel’s royal family, namely a lion, a vine, and a scepter, Ezekiel criticizes Israel’s royal family (Genesis 49:9-11). He prophesies that a worthy royal son will one day be born and rule his people in justice. 

In Ezekiel’s riddle, a lioness raises a cub to be a ferocious predator. But quickly, Egyptian hunters conspire to trap and kill the lion (Ezekiel 19:2-4). But undeterred by her son’s death, the lioness raises another more violent and terrifying cub. But this new predator meets the same fate. This time, Babylonian hunters stalk, capture, and kill the beast and carry its carcass to a faraway land (Ezekiel 19:5-9). The lioness is Israel. The ferocious cubs are two of Israel’s last kings. The evil king Jehoahaz was captured and carried to Egypt. His evil brother Jehoiakim then took the throne only to be quickly deposed and exiled to Babylon (2 Chronicles 36:2-8). Like wild lions, Israel’s kings have ruled through terror and violence. And just as you put down a dangerous animal, God has culled Israel’s royal family.

Ezekiel then cryptically compares Jehoiakim’s son, Jehoiachin, to a vine. A full and fruiting grapevine is planted by a stream (Ezekiel 19:10). It towers above even the tallest trees, and its branches are fine enough to harvest as royal scepters (Ezekiel 19:11). But from this great height, an unnamed power strips, prunes, uproots, and burns the vine. This power then plants a single withered branch in the desert (Ezekiel 19:12-14). The vine is Israel's royal family. The fact that it is fruiting represents how, in the past, Israel has produced great leaders who wielded their scepters with justice. The unnamed power is God burying Israel for its corruption. And the withered branch planted in the desert is King Jehoiachin. He is the last living member of Israel’s royal family. But now, he sits in a Babylonian prison (2 Kings 24:8-17).

Interestingly, Ezekiel’s two riddles follow the normal poetic rules that govern dirges, songs reserved for funerals. While these riddles criticize Israel’s royal family, they are also a way to process the grief of losing their king and kingdom. God promised King David his family line, and kingdom would last forever (2 Samuel 7:11-16). But this riddle laments that this promise seems almost entirely lost. Israel’s only hope is the imprisoned Jehoiachin, the last withered stalk of David’s family tree. Israel’s only hope is that the royal line will not be entirely lost and a worthy son will finally be born.

Where is the Gospel?

The worthy son finally born from David’s withered family tree is Jesus (Matthew 1:1; Isaiah 11:1; Zechariah 3:8; Jeremiah 23:5). Raised in the all-but-deserted town of Nazareth, he was the royal descendant, and worthy son Israel had been waiting for (Luke 2:39-40). As Jesus rose to power, he did not rule through terror or violence but, in compassion, healed and fed his people (Matthew 9:35-36; John 6:11-14). Jesus refused to be like Israel’s previous violent kings. So much so that when God’s people tried to make him king by force, he refused (John 6:15).

Jesus’ kingdom was not one of animal savagery but of self-sacrifice. His crown was made of twisted vines; his throne was a cross made from gnarled, unvarnished wood. His first act as the long-awaited Son of David was to die for his people. Instead of preying upon his citizens, he offered his own body and blood to provide for them (Luke 22:19-20). 

But Jesus’ body wasn’t merely buried; it was planted. After three days of germination, Jesus rose from the dead. Jesus is the worthy son finally born of the withered stalk of Jehoiachin’s royal line. The book of Revelation tells us that Jesus is the true Lion of Israel’s royal line and the Vine of David and that he now sits with God as the true King over his people forever (Revelation 5:5). God’s King and Kingdom have not been lost, they have been raised to the eternal throne promised to David. We don’t need to sing dirges anymore because our King has left his grave behind and lives forever. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has given us a King. May you see Jesus as the wise, just, and good King who rules forever. "

That king is named Jesus.",Website,Ezekiel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

When Israel first became a nation, God made a covenant with them. God promised to preserve their nation and protect it from enemy invasion as long as Israel continued to trust and worship him. But God also warned that Israel could break their treaty by trusting foreign armies and gods. If they did, the covenant states that God will temporarily remove Israel from their land, purify it of any evil and idolatry, and, after a time, return his people (Deuteronomy 30:1-10). Israel has broken this treaty. Already, many of Israel’s leaders and nobility have been deported to the growing superpower Babylon (2 Kings 24:1-15). So, in a series of prophetic parables, Ezekiel warns Israel’s leaders that if they continue to trust other gods and kings, God will summon Babylon to destroy what’s left of Israel.

In Ezekiel’s first parable, a great eagle breaks off the highest branch of a cedar tree and replants it in a faraway land (Ezekiel 17:1-4). It symbolizes how Babylon’s king Nebuchadnezzar carted off Israel’s most prominent citizens in its first invasion (Ezekiel 17:12). That same eagle then returns to Israel and gently plants several seedlings back in Israel, where they begin to grow (Ezekiel 17:5-6). This refers to Nebuchadnezzar replacing Israel’s previous king with a man named Zedekiah (2 Chronicles 36:11-14; Ezekiel 17:13-14). But a second eagle lands nearby, and the seedlings start growing their roots toward it, rather than rooting themselves where the first eagle placed them (Ezekiel 17:7-8). This refers to how Zedekiah attempted a coup with assistance from Egypt instead of trusting Babylon’s rule (Ezekiel 17:15). Zedekiah should have trusted that it was ultimately God who planted them back in Israel, like the covenant promised. Israel’s attempted coup is not merely a crime against Babylon but proof of Israel’s unwillingness to submit to God and his plans. For Zedekiah’s failure to trust that God had chosen Babylon for their protection, Ezekiel says Babylon will invade again, Zedekiah’s coup will be crushed, and he will die in a Babylonian prison (Ezekiel 17:16-21).

In Ezekiel’s second parable, he describes how God will be faithful to his covenant with Israel after Babylon’s second invasion. In it, God is a gardener. God approaches a tall tree, cuts off a branch, and personally plants it on the mountains of Israel. This branch then grows into a mighty cedar, and soon, birds from all over the world will come and live in its shade (Ezekiel 17:22-24). The parable of the cedar represents God’s faithfulness to his covenant and the preservation of Israel’s line of kings. It’s a promise that by God’s power, a new faithful king will sprout in Israel and that the nations will all flock to him, trusting him for protection and provision (Ezekiel 17:23-24).

Where is the Gospel?

Israel and her kings were supposed to trust God for their nation’s preservation and protection. But instead, Zedekiah trusted Egypt. And just as Ezekiel prophesied, Babylon invaded Israel, destroyed their capital, and deported most of its people (2 Chronicles 36:15-23; Ezekiel 33). But despite Israel’s lack of trust, Ezekiel also prophesied that God was not ultimately a destroyer but a gardener. He would replant Israel’s royal family and personally raise up a new king for his people. That king is named Jesus.

God took Jesus from the very heights of heaven and planted him in the lowly soil of his people’s exile on earth (John 1:1,14; Hebrews 2:9). And just as Zedekiah was supposed to accept Babylon’s rule over Israel, Jesus submitted to the Roman authorities that God had put over his people. He trusted God even when those authorities came to kill him (Matthew 26:50-56). And Jesus trusted that God’s hand was behind the hands that crucified him. 

Just as God promised, God planted a new faithful king in Israel. Like the seeds in Ezekiel’s parable, he was buried, and like all seeds, he rose from the dirt to rule God’s people forever (Matthew 28:1-10). Like Ezekiel, Jesus taught that his kingdom would grow like a massive tree and that the nations of the world could find rest in the protective shade he provides (Matthew 13:31-32). And Jesus’ resurrection proves him right! Jesus is the mighty cedar that the entire world can flock to for a home under his branches and protection from their enemies (John 12:32-33; Acts 2:36,39). You don’t need to look anywhere else for your protection and provision (Philippians 4:19). Jesus is the mighty king who provides and protects those who trust in him (Ephesians 2:4-7).

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is worthy of your trust. And may you see Jesus as God’s chosen king who protects and provides for his people. "

When Babylon’s armies attacked Israel and exiled many of its people, the neighboring nation of Edom took advantage of Israel’s vulnerable position and plotted to plunder several of its cities and take control of the region. For this, Ezekiel says that God will punish the nation of Edom (which he calls the mountain of Seir). God has heard all of Edom’s conspiracies and will soon treat them the way they treated Israel. Since Edom celebrated Israel’s desolation, they will become a desolate land (Ezekiel 35:1-15). 

Ezekiel also tells Israel that even though their land has been invaded and plundered, he will restore them. He has seen Edom’s opportunistic invasion and promises to avenge them (Ezekiel 36:1-7). God is committed to restoring his people and protecting them from their enemies. He promises to make Israel a fruitful land and prosperous nation again. He will repopulate Israel’s towns, multiply their livestock, and replant their crops (Ezekiel 36:8-12). God is for Israel, and he will bring down all her enemies (Ezekiel 36:13-15).

But Ezekiel reminds Israel they are not innocent victims. Israel was supposed to show the world the goodness of their God by loving him and loving one another. But for centuries, Israel has killed one another and loved idols more than their God. Israel’s past actions have obscured the world’s view of the goodness of God and shamed God’s reputation among the nations (Ezekiel 36:16-23). Their exile in Babylon is a deserved punishment for a history of evil. Nevertheless, God promises to soon cleanse his people of their guilt and soften their hearts to obey him. He will even put his own Spirit in them so that they can finally love both their God and one another (Ezekiel 36:24-27). Ezekiel is insistent Israel doesn’t deserve this, but God will do it anyway. For the sake of his own reputation, God will forgive his people. Then, the world will finally know that God is a God of goodness, grace, and forgiveness for the undeserving (Ezekiel 36:28-32). Soon, God will rebuild their ruined towns into fortified cities, turn Israel’s wastelands into cultivated gardens, and God’s people will live in the land once again (Ezekiel 36:33-38).

Where is the Gospel?

Just as Ezekiel prophesied and God promised, Israel did return to their homeland. But their return did little to soften their hearts. Israel did not get better at showing the world the goodness of God. But God did not forget his promise to fill their hearts with his Spirit and transform them into people who can represent him to the world by finally being able to love God and one another. These promises finally came true when God determined to vindicate his reputation by sending his son, Jesus. Jesus secured the forgiveness God’s people were waiting for and the world needed to see.

Throughout the Old Testament, God’s people were forgiven of their sins and evil through sacrifice. So God, in Jesus, died as a sacrifice to forgive all his people publicly. On the cross, God’s reputation as a God of love and forgiveness was globally demonstrated. Jesus secured forgiveness for all of his people’s failure, sin, and disobedience. But God did not only promise forgiveness but a heart transformed by God’s Spirit (Ezekiel 36:26-27). 

So, by the power of God’s Spirit, Jesus rose from the dead and prepared to send his Spirit to his followers (Romans 8:11; John 14:15-17). And only a few days later, God’s Spirit came to God’s people. And just as God promised, God’s Spirit transformed those who accepted his gift. In love, all those gathered immediately began selling their possessions to care for those in need. In a small way, the plundering of Israel at the hands of nations like Babylon and Edom was finally being reversed (Acts 2:42-47). And since that day, the good news of God’s grace and forgiveness towards the undeserving has traveled around the world and across the internet. If you are reading this right now, it’s proof that God has vindicated his reputation and transformed his people, just like he promised.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who cleanses us from all our sin. And may you see Jesus as the one who cleans us with his blood and makes us new with his Spirit."

For the last several chapters, Ezekiel prophesies the destruction of six nations that celebrated Israel’s fall to Babylon and took advantage of them in their weakened state. In a seventh and climactic prophecy, Ezekiel says that Egypt will be destroyed too. In the past, Egypt enslaved the entire population of Israel when they were a nomadic tribe in the desert. The current pharaoh of Egypt has not only committed atrocities but claimed he is a god who created the Nile River. So, in a series of prophecies, Ezekiel tells Pharaoh that God raised Babylon to humble and destroy Egypt for their pride, opportunism, and evil. In his pride, Pharaoh is depicted as a vicious sea dragon claiming dominion over his kingdom (Ezekiel 29:1-3). But Ezekiel warns that God will harpoon him out of his watery realm and toss him into the desert, where he is powerless. There, he will die, and his carcass will be eaten by wild beasts and birds (Ezekiel 29:4-5). To God, Pharaoh is not a fierce dragon deity but a beached whale. Ezekiel says that within forty years, Egypt will only be a skeleton of the empire it once was, never to rise in pride or power again (Ezekiel 29:6-16). God will send the armies of Babylon to level Pharaoh’s pride and give Egypt’s wealth to the king of Babylon (Ezekiel 29:17-20). For an entire chapter, Ezekiel describes the comprehensive devastation Babylon will wreak on Egypt’s land, cities, and people (Ezekiel 30:1-19). With no allies to save them, Egypt will be destroyed, never to rise again (Ezekiel 30:20-26). Egypt’s only hope to save their nation is to humble themselves and submit to Babylon’s power.

About a year later, Ezekiel intensifies his prophecies against Pharaoh’s pride. He compares Pharaoh and Egypt to the most beautiful tree in the Garden of Eden and the tallest cedar in Lebanon’s then-famous forests. Its strong and leafy branches give shade to all animals looking for relief from the hot sun (Ezekiel 31:1-9). But the tree becomes proud of its position of prominence, and Babylon promptly cuts it down (Ezekiel 31:10-13). This tree is then buried. This is a warning for Pharaoh and a lesson for the other nations (Ezekiel 31:14-18). Pharaoh and Egypt will not only be brought down for their national pride but globally humiliated. Once Egypt has been hurled down like a tree, Ezekiel brings up the sea dragon metaphor again (Ezekiel 32:1-2). The sea dragon of Egypt will be left to rot in the desert by the armies of Babylon (Ezekiel 32:3-16). The dragon metaphor is brought up again to emphasize that Egypt’s fall will surely come to pass. Ezekiel adds that after Egypt is politically humiliated, the sea dragon of Egypt will be condemned to the underworld, where even the dead will mock his fall from power (Ezekiel 32:3-16,17-31). The point of Ezekiel’s prophecies is clear. Egypt’s pride is monstrous. Egypt’s king thinks he is a god, and for that pride, God has sent Babylon to humble Egypt. 

Where is the Gospel?

Part of the reason Ezekiel included this prophecy against Egypt is that throughout Babylon’s siege of Jerusalem, Israel’s leaders looked to an alliance with Egypt to save them from Babylon’s attack. In part, Ezekiel is warning Israel not to trust the proud nation of Egypt because no arrogant ruler, no matter how powerful, can stand against the inevitable power of God. God will always bring low those who take advantage of the weak and rebel against him in their pride. And just as he slew the sea dragon Pharaoh, God will slay all proud powers. Eventually, God sent the ultimate dragon-slayer, Jesus, to judge the ultimate dragon, Satan.

Satan appears in the first pages of the Bible as a dragon, a talking snake that convinced God’s children, Adam and Eve, to proudly rebel against their creator (Genesis 3:1). From that moment on, God promised that Satan and his offspring would be at war with Eve and her sons. But he also promised that one day, one of Eve’s sons would crush Satan’s power forever (Genesis 3:15). From that moment on, the Bible’s story is full of powerful rulers like Pharaoh and King Herod, who murdered Hebrew boys in an attempt to stop the dragon-crusher Jesus from being born. 

But they all failed. Jesus was born, and his life was marked by his power to cast out demons, free people in bondage to Satan’s power, and conquer death (Matthew 8:16). Just as God promised Eve, Jesus crushed Satan’s power by rising from the dead. Satan could not keep Jesus locked in the underworld. In his resurrection, the monstrous powers of corrupt religion, murderous kings, and even death are totally disarmed and defanged (Colossians 2:15). Jesus is the ultimate dragon-slayer. Through his death and resurrection, he has disarmed our ultimate enemy. And one day, he will slay the final dragon and its allies and leave their bodies to the birds (Revelation 19:17-21). He will hurl down the dragon, the grave, and death itself to their destruction (Revelation 20:10,14). When Jesus is done, all pride and evil will be gone forever. Those who take advantage of the weak will be brought to justice. Israel should’ve trusted God to save their nation over proud allies doomed to fall. Likewise, we should trust the only one who has defeated Satan and Death and has the power to set the world right.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who always humbles the proud. And may you see Jesus as the one who destroys all proud powers."

Israel’s capital has been destroyed, and Israel’s people have been deported to Babylon. They are now slaves to a power they cannot defeat. But Ezekiel prophesies that Israel's enemies will soon be lured into a battle they cannot win. Ezekiel personifies all Israel’s enemies as a mysterious and monstrous king named Gog. One day, Gog will unify Israel’s enemies from every corner of the world (Ezekiel 38:1-6). Gog will think Israel’s cities are defenseless and begin leading his giant international army to plunder them (Ezekiel 38:7-14). But when Gog crosses Israel’s border, Ezekiel says God will rise like a warrior and destroy Gog and his opportunistic army (Ezekiel 38:15-23). 

The aftermath of God’s justice is intense. Gog is disarmed and disabled. Gog’s slain soldiers rot under the desert sun. And God sends fire to burn enemy cities to dust (Ezekiel 39:1-6). Ezekiel says there will be so many discarded wooden shields and spears that God’s people won’t need to cut firewood for the next seven years (Ezekiel 39:7-10). Eventually, God’s people will start to clean their land of the dead bodies that are polluting it. Ezekiel says that for seven months, they will throw the bones and corpses of Gog’s soldiers into a dark pit where vultures and scavenging animals will gorge themselves on Israel’s enemies (Ezekiel 39:11-20). It’s a gruesome image, but the message is simple. Every enemy that has threatened or attacked God’s people will be entirely consumed.

Over and over, Ezekiel says this battle against Gog will prove that God has not forgotten his people and is greater than their enemies (Ezekiel 38:15-16, 23, 29:6-7, 21-23). It’s true that Israel is in exile under Babylonian control. It’s also true that even more powerful enemies will attempt to wipe Israel off the map. But Ezekiel’s prophecies against Gog prove that God has not forgotten his people. Foreign oppression, slavery, and national shame are not what God ultimately intends for Israel (Ezekiel 39:21-24). Rather, God intends to consume every enemy of his people. God will protect, preserve, and be with his people forever (Ezekiel 39:25-29). Ezekiel's prophecies against Gog should comfort Israel that God’s power and loyalty to his people will soon be proven on a global stage. 

Where is the Gospel?

The only other place Gog shows up in the Bible is in the book of Revelation, where the apostle John describes a final climactic battle between God and his people’s enemies. The battles are remarkably similar. In both, Gog gathers a global army from north, south, east, and west. In both, God wins the war by sending fire from heaven (Ezekiel 39:6; Revelation 20:9). In both, the dead are gathered in one place to be divinely judged (Ezekiel 39:11-20; Revelation 20:7-10). In both, God offers the bodies of Gog’s soldiers as a feast for birds and scavenging animals (Ezekiel 39:17-20; Revelation 19:17-18). Ezekiel and John are talking about the same event. While Israel may have assumed the defeat of her enemies was largely political, John’s account shows us that Ezekiel is describing a victory greater than the destruction of Babylon. Both Ezekiel and John are talking about the day God finally consumes the powers behind all world powers, the forces of death, evil, and chaos. 

Ezekiel and John’s prophecies of destruction should offer us hope. God has not forgotten us, and God will defeat our enemies. You may or may not be familiar with the evils of political and military enemies. Still, all of us have been wounded in our own battles against evil, death, and chaos (Ephesians 6:12). Ezekiel and John both prophesy that these powers will all be consumed forever. The reason we can be confident in their defeat is not simply because Ezekiel and John have prophesied about it but because God has already won a decisive victory against them. 

God himself went to war against the forces of evil, chaos, and death in the person of Jesus. In that battle, Jesus was temporarily crushed under the thumb of Gog. For three days, the forces of evil, chaos, and death seemed to have won. But Jesus rose from his grave. Jesus is more powerful than Gog (Colossians 2:15). God has disarmed Gog, which means the forces of death, evil, and chaos have no ultimate power over Jesus and his followers. So, no matter what enemies are attacking you, know that Jesus will consume them. Jesus has died to protect, preserve, and be with you forever. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who will finally consume evil. And may you see Jesus as our warrior who soon defeats all our enemies. "

Ezekiel has spent the last 24 chapters prophesying about God’s anger toward the evil, idolatry, and oppression in Israel. But now, Ezekiel switches his prophetic target to Israel’s enemies. Ezekiel says that Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyre, and Sidon will all fall. When Babylon invaded Jerusalem, these nations celebrated their rival’s downfall and even plundered the ruined city. Isaiah prophecies that one by one, they will be destroyed so that one day, Israel can return home, never to be harmed by their enemies again (Ezekiel 28:25-26). Even though God is angry with his people’s evil, that doesn’t mean he won’t protect them. 

In malice, Ammon and Moab gloated over Israel’s demise, so Ezekiel says God will give their nations as plunder to Babylon (Ezekiel 25:1-11). When Israel was weak, Edom and Philistia saw their chance to get revenge and attacked Israel while vulnerable. So God says he will avenge his people and destroy these nations for the pleasure they feel in getting even (Ezekiel 25:12-17). God also announces Israel’s northern neighbor Sidon will fall (Ezekiel 28:20-24). Ezekiel ends each of his oracles against Israel’s enemies by saying that in their destruction, God is proving himself faithful to Israel (Ezekiel 25:7, 11, 14, 17, 28:24). Even though God is angry at the evil in Israel and Babylon has conquered them, God has not forgotten that the Israelites are still his people. 

Ezekiel aims most of his condemnation toward the island city of Tyre. Tyre likely gets special attention because it had become extremely wealthy and powerful through trade and shipping. Tyre’s king also believes he’s a god and invulnerable to Babylon’s military campaign and God’s judgment (Ezekiel 28:1-5). So God promises to turn their island kingdom into a bare rock in the sea (Ezekiel 26:1-21). In anticipation of this destruction, Ezekiel writes two eulogies. One to be read over the nation of Tyre’s future grave, and another to be read over the king. In the first, he describes Tyre as a luxurious merchant ship filled with treasures and manned by a diverse group of mariners, traders, and mercenaries (Ezekiel 27:1-24). But while loaded with cargo and people, the ship of Tyre sinks to the bottom of the ocean (Ezekiel 27:25-36). In the second eulogy, Ezekiel satirically elevates the king of Tyre before describing his tragic fall (Ezekiel 28:6-19). The point of these eulogies is to prove once again that God is still loyal to his people. Even in their disobedience, God has not forgotten them and has gone to battle against their enemies.

Where is the Gospel?

While these oracles are against proud nations, they are for a destroyed Israel. Each prophecy proves that God has not forgotten his people in their exile. Even though Israel has abandoned God, God is fighting and conquering Israel’s most ancient enemies. But the defeat of Israel’s enemies through Babylon’s army was only the beginning. Eventually, God would send his son, Jesus, to wage war against greater, more godlike, and more proud enemies than Tyre.

While we were still disobedient and disloyal to God, our ancient enemies, Satan and Death, plundered our lives and tried to devour us like Israel’s enemies (Genesis 4:7; James 1:14-16). But in God’s love for us, Jesus went to battle against them and gave his life to free us from their power. Jesus humiliated and shamed the power of Satan and Death when he rose from the grave (Colossians 2:15). Our most ancient enemies are not a threat to us anymore. God’s judgment of Death and Sin proves that God is still fighting for us. We can safely return to our home with God and know we will not be harmed by them again. No matter how disobedient or far from God you think you might be, Jesus has not forgotten you. Rather, he has fought and died for you. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is loyal when we are not. And may you see Jesus as the one who has defeated our enemies by his death. "

God chose the kingdom of Israel to bring flourishing to the world in hopes of causing all people to worship God (Genesis 12:1-3). But Israel has abandoned that call in favor of bloodshed and idolatry. God tells Ezekiel to act as his prosecuting attorney and declare Israel’s capital, Jerusalem, guilty in a global trial (Ezekiel 22:1-5). The evidence is as follows: Israel’s kings have killed to protect their power. Immigrants, orphans, and widows are systemically oppressed. Slander, incest, adultery, bribery, and extortion are pervasive (Ezekiel 22:6-12). For these crimes, the attorney Ezekiel seeks the death sentence. Israel should be exiled from her homeland and scattered in shame among the people they were meant to bless (Ezekiel 22:13-16).

But God still intends for Israel to bring flourishing to the world. To him, exile is not primarily a punishment; it is a refining in hopes of a better future. Like a blacksmith purifies silver by melting it in a forge, God will turn Jerusalem into his crucible. Inside the city’s walls, his people’s violence and idolatry will be burned out of it. What’s left behind will be a pure people ready and able to carry on God’s mission (Ezekiel 22:17-22). For now, everyone in Israel is guilty and in danger of his purifying fire (Ezekiel 22:30-31). Israel is full of conspiring kings, abusive priests, oppressive leaders, lying prophets, and thieving subjects (Ezekiel 22:23-29). But God promises that soon, Israel will recover her calling and mission in the world. The coming exile shouldn’t be avoided as punishment but embraced as a purification. God is a master blacksmith, and he will make his people into the purest possible silver. 

Hoping to shock Israel with the severity of their guilt and their need to embrace their exile, Ezekiel, in pornographic detail, describes God’s people as two prostitute sisters (Ezekiel 23:1-4). You can read the details for yourself, but both sisters are described as women who crave to be touched, loved, and ravished by any passing soldier (Ezekiel 23:5-8, 11-21). Their lusts represent the political, religious, and moral compromises God’s people made as they rejected their call to bless the world. God’s judgment is that if Israel so desires to be intimate with other nations, he will give Israel precisely what she wants. The same nations they’ve given themselves to will enter her cities, strip them bare, and expose Israel for the prostitute she’s become (Ezekiel 23:9-10, 22-45). Once again, Ezekiel declares Israel guilty and, once again, demands the death sentence (Ezekiel 23:46-47). But Ezekiel also knows that this death sentence is not final. Israel’s death and exile serve a higher purpose. The exile will purify God’s people, and soon Israel will reclaim its calling to bring flourishing to the world (Ezekiel 23:48-49). 

Where is the Gospel?

The world is a broken, evil, and harsh place. It is badly in need of the blessing and flourishing Israel was chosen to provide but failed to deliver. But Ezekiel prophesied that after the crucible of exile and national death, God’s people would rise again, reclaim their calling, and finally bring flourishing to the world. However, the forge of national death and exile was not enough to fully purify and refine God’s people. Israel remained full of evil after Babylon’s invasion. So God, the divine blacksmith, determined to come to Israel once again to finally purify his people in Jesus.

Like Ezekiel, the prosecuting attorney, Jesus approached Jerusalem and judged it and its leaders for their injustice, idolatry, and evil (Matthew 23:1-36; Mark 11:15-18). Jesus prophesied that the only way God’s people would be purified was for Israel’s corrupt religious system to be destroyed and burned down (Mark 13:1-37). But even as Jesus spoke these fiery words, he said that those oppressed by Israel’s leaders—the immigrants, orphans, and widows––would be the first citizens of the purified Kingdom he was preparing (Matthew 5:1-12). During Jesus’ ministry, prostitutes became daughters of God (Luke 7:37). Those possessed by demons became missionaries (Luke 8:26-29). Both violent revolutionaries like Simon and turncoat Israelites like Matthew became disciples (Mark 3:13-19). Jesus purified and transformed his people just as Ezekiel prophesied. 

Ezekiel said Jerusalem would be purified through the invasion of Babylon. This is why Jesus allowed his body to die on a Roman cross. Jesus died because he wanted to become his people’s crucible. On the cross, Jesus accepted the impurity, evil, and sin of his people (2 Corinthians 5:21). He was stripped bare and exposed for his people’s evil. His body became the forge in which the impurity of his people would be burned away. In him, as in Jerusalem, our evil, idolatry, and bloodshed are purified (Hebrews 9:14). Jesus became the forge in which our evil was refined so that we might become like silver—precious, pure, and ready to join his Kingdom of blessing and bring flourishing to the world.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who judges his people for their violence and idolatry. And may you see Jesus as the crucible we can throw ourselves into."

In two prophecies, Ezekiel describes Israel’s unfaithfulness and the consequences of abandoning their God. Throughout the Bible, Israel is described as a specially chosen vine meant to give fruit and life to the world (Genesis 49:22; Psalm 80:8-11; Isaiah 5:1-7). But in Ezekiel’s first prophecy, there is no fruit in Israel, and the vines are dry and brittle. While every other type of dead wood can be made into something useful (like furniture), the only thing a dead vine can do well is burn (Ezekiel 15:1-5). In Babylon’s first invasion, God burned many of Israel’s “vines” by deporting several of its corrupt leaders to Babylon’s capital. And Ezekiel prophecies that soon, God will send Babylon again to deport even more of Israel’s citizens (Ezekiel 15:6-8).

In the second prophecy, Ezekiel imaginatively describes Israel as a naked baby girl left to die in the desert (Ezekiel 16:1-5). When God sees her, he immediately picks her up, takes her home, and gives her a new life under his care (Ezekiel 16:6). As she matures into a young woman, God promises to always protect and care for her. So he marries her (Ezekiel 16:7-8). Like an affectionate husband, God lavishes her with gifts of the finest clothes and jewelry. Then, like a king, he raises her to rule as his queen (Ezekiel 16:9-14). This set of images should remind Israel of how God rescued her from her captivity in Egypt and gave her a kingdom in the land he promised them. 

Continuing his imaginative retelling of Israel’s history, Ezekiel then describes how quickly Israel abandons her new husband. She leverages her beauty and power to become a globally sought-after prostitute. She uses God’s gifts to create shrines and idols to get in bed with the gods of other nations (Ezekiel 16:15-19). In her lust to gain the favor of multiple foreign kings, she slaughters her own children on foreign altars. She completely forgets the care and compassion God showed at Israel’s founding and begins to pay foreign nations for the love and protection that God freely gave (Ezekiel 16:20-34). Since his bride so loves to sell and expose herself to the world, God says he will gather all her lovers together and let them all have their way with her. For her unfaithfulness and idolatry, Israel will be plundered by the nations she once paid (Ezekiel 16:35-42). Ezekiel even says that Jerusalem is worse than Sodom and Samaria, two cities infamous for their wickedness and sexual immorality (Ezekiel 16:43-52). 

Surprisingly, Ezekiel says that after Israel has been laid waste, God will restore her to her former beauty (Ezekiel 16:53-58). Even after all Israel has done to deserve God’s anger, God promises to renew his marriage vows (Ezekiel 16:59-61). God will once again come to forgive her past infidelity and be a loving husband to his wayward bride forever (Ezekiel 16:62-63).

Where is the Gospel?

Ezekiel's prophetic oracles can be hard to read, but that’s part of the point. They are meant to shock Israel into seeing the horror of their actions. To God, their political and religious unfaithfulness has made Israel into a brazen prostitute or dead wood ready for the fire. But Ezekiel says even though Israel is a runaway bride, God is a pursuing husband. Eventually, God, the groom, came to win back his unfaithful bride in Jesus. 

Jesus’ first miracle occurred at a wedding, and some of Jesus’ first followers were prostitutes and the sexually immoral (John 2:1-12; Matthew 21:31). Jesus is the God who wants to marry his wayward bride. In Ezekiel, God's pursuit of his bride looked like protecting a young girl, making her his queen, and lavishing her with gifts. But Jesus’ pursuit of his runaway bride is seen in the great sufferings he undergoes to wash away her infidelities. To clothe her in unearned dignity, he was stripped on a cross (John 19:23-24). To heal her wounds, he was beaten and killed (1 Peter 2:24). Jesus pursued his bride through humiliation and death so that he could wash away his bride’s past immorality forever (Ephesians 5:25-27). Jesus is the faithful husband of Ezekiel’s prophecies.

Nothing stops God’s pursuit of his people. The story of Jesus proves to us that there is no unfaithfulness, promiscuity, or idolatry that God is not willing to forgive. It doesn’t matter how much you’ve run from God because God is running toward you. And right now, he stands ready to accept you as his beloved forever. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who loves his people despite their unfaithfulness. May you see Jesus as the one who died for his bride to give her his life and glory."

",Website,Ezekiel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

In a vision, God shows Ezekiel a mass grave full of bones. The mass grave represents Israel’s exile in Babylon (Ezekiel 37:1-2). Israel’s exile seems like the death of all God’s promises to his people. And God asks Ezekiel if he thinks the kingdom of Israel can ever be restored (Ezekiel 37:3). Ezekiel knows that God can bring life from death. Still, he also knows that his people’s evil has caused their exile and that they deserve their current separation from God and his promises. So Ezekiel says only God knows the future of his people. In response, God says that Israel’s national death is only temporary, and soon he will resurrect his people. God tells Ezekiel to command the bones to listen to his voice (Ezekiel 37:4-6). When Ezekiel does, God’s Spirit rushes over the bones, assembles them into skeletons, and covers them in muscle and skin (Ezekiel 37:7-8). God then fills the corpses with his Spirit, and a living nation fills the valley (Ezekiel 37:9-10). This vision should give hope to Israel (Ezekiel 37:11). Despite their disobedience, God will bring them back from exile, resurrect their kingdom, and be faithful to his promises (Ezekiel 37:12-14).

More than simply reversing the Babylonian exile, God also promises to restore Israel to its former glory. For centuries, Israel was divided by a civil war that slowly poisoned and killed both parties. But now, God says he will undo the death their civil war introduced and reunite Israel’s divided nation. To demonstrate this promise, God tells Ezekiel to carve the name of Judah on a large stick and Ephraim on another and hold them together in a public ceremony (Ezekiel 37:15-17). The united pieces of wood promise that when God returns his people from exile, he will heal Israel’s division and unite his people (Ezekiel 37:18-21).

Then Ezekiel prophesies that God will raise up a new king to rule Israel’s newly united kingdom (Ezekiel 37:22-23). This king will be a descendant of King David, the king who first united all Israel’s tribes and established Israel as a kingdom (2 Samuel 5:1-3). And God promises this new king will rule over an eternal and united kingdom of Israel forever (Ezekiel 37:24-26). Most importantly, God says that when this king takes the throne, God will live among his people once again (Ezekiel 37:27-28).

Where is the Gospel?

On the first pages of the Bible, God’s life-giving Spirit hovered over the chaotic and lifeless waters of the earth and created order and life (Genesis 1:1-2). And in Ezekiel, God’s Spirit brings life and order out of the death and chaos of Israel’s exile. Ezekiel’s vision of a valley of bones coming to life is a promise that God’s kingdom would be remade. Most importantly, it was a prophecy that under the reign of a new son of David, Israel’s exile would end, and God’s Spirit would fill his people forever. The son of David, who resurrects God’s people and fills them with God’s Spirit, is the man named Jesus (Matthew 1:1).

Just as Ezekiel saw God’s Spirit raise a nation of bones and end Israel’s exile, Jesus raised multiple people from the dead (Matthew 9:23-25; Luke 7:11-17; John 11:43-44). Jesus is the life-giving and uniting King that God promised Ezekiel. He came to end his people’s separation from God and restore God’s promises of an eternal Kingdom. Ultimately, Jesus secured God’s promises and his people’s eternal Kingdom not only by raising others from the dead but by dying and rising himself. After his death, God’s Spirit raised Jesus from his grave (Romans 8:11-13). And now Jesus, the son of David, sits on an eternal throne next to God (Mark 16:19). 

And just like Ezekiel prophesied, Jesus the King fills his people with his Spirit (John 14:16-17). Just as God’s Spirit rushed over the bones in Ezekiel’s vision, God’s Spirit rushed on Jesus’ first disciples (Acts 2:1-2). And anyone who trusted in the death-ending power of Jesus received God’s Spirit too (Acts 2:38). At some point, all of us will feel like a jumble of dry bones—lifeless, separated from God, and unable to know if God is still on our side. But Jesus’ death and resurrection promise that God’s life-giving Spirit is available to all who ask. Just as Israel needed to trust that God’s promises would come true on the other side of exile, we must trust that God’s promises have begun to come true in Jesus. When we trust that Jesus truly is the King God’s people have been waiting for, he will breathe life into your dead body and give you the gift of his Spirit. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who forgives sins and raises people from the dead. And may you see Jesus as the promised King who unites people to each other and to God."

The nations of Ammon and Israel are preparing for war. Both nations recently attempted coups against Babylon, and now Babylon is gathering its armies to counterstrike. Panicked, Israel’s political leaders ask Ezekiel for God’s guidance. But God refuses to speak to them (Ezekiel 20:1-4). Ezekiel explains that because Israel has failed to listen to God in the past, God will offer no guidance now. From their beginnings in Egypt up to this moment, Israel has rejected God, worshiped other deities, built idols, and even sacrificed their children to demons (Ezekiel 20:5-29). For hundreds of years, Israel has consistently rejected God’s guidance, willingly embraced idolatry, and sought counsel from pagan deities. Even though Israel is under threat, God promises he will not speak to Israel’s hypocritical leaders (Ezekiel 20:30-33). Babylon’s invasion and God’s silence will destroy Israel’s hypocritical and idolatrous leaders to make room for new and better rulers (Ezekiel 20:34-38).

But God also promises that this judgment will not be ultimate. Their time of discipline in Babylon’s deserts will purify God’s people of their hypocrisy and idolatry. On that day, God himself will be their King (Ezekiel 20:33). And he will call his people back to their homeland, where they will worship him again (Ezekiel 20:41-44). But before that restoration, Ezekiel reiterates that Babylon will first act as God’s sword on the earth and purify Jerusalem of its unwillingness to listen and idolatry (Ezekiel 21:1-17). 

As a way to highlight the foolishness of listening to other gods, God tells Ezekiel that Babylon’s king will invade Israel because his idols will tell him to do so. Ironically, these idols would have been the same gods Israel imported into Israel. The gods of Babylon will betray Israel (Ezekiel 21:18-24). All Israel’s wicked leaders will be dethroned and disgraced until God raises up a worthy king to replace their corrupt leadership (Ezekiel 21:25-27). Ezekiel then reminds Ammon that Babylon will punish them, too. Even though Babylon seemingly bypassed them on the way to attack Israel, Ezekiel warns that they are next (Ezekiel 21:28-32).

Where is the Gospel?

Israel and her leaders have chronically, habitually, and rebelliously closed their ears to God’s guidance. God’s silence, Babylon’s invasion, and Israel's exile were the purifying punishments for the idolatry, child sacrifice, and dishonor Israel had brought to God’s name. But despite this, God promised that his silence and his people’s destruction would not be ultimate. After their exile, God would purify his people and raise up a worthy king to lead them (Ezekiel 21:25-27). That king is named Jesus.

Unlike Israel’s past leaders, Jesus perfectly listens to and obeys God (John 4:34, 5:30, 6:38, 8:26, 10:18, 12:49-50, 14:30-31, 15:10). Instead of simply accepting the corruption he saw around him like so many of Israel’s kings, Jesus spends much of his ministry confronting Israel’s hypocritical and evil leaders (Matthew 21:12-15, 23:23-32). But the way that Jesus replaced the corrupt leaders of his day was not by bringing a powerful army to level Jerusalem, but by dying in obedience to God’s guidance. The rulers of Jesus’ day used all their power to silence him, but he rose from the dead. Jesus proved that listening to and obeying God’s guidance is more powerful than all the machinations and plots of leaders and empires (Colossians 2:15). Jesus now sits on a throne above every nation and land (Acts 7:55–56). Jesus is King over life, death, and the earth forever, and he is calling all of us to listen to him. If we do, he will lead us not into death and exile but into eternal life in his eternal homeland. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who keeps his promises to restore his people despite their unfaithfulness. And may you see Jesus as the King who both purifies our hearts and restores us to our land."

God built his true temple when he came to earth as the true Israelite, Jesus.",Website,Ezekiel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The book of Ezekiel begins with God showing his prophet a horrifying picture of God’s temple. What was supposed to be a place of freedom, forgiveness, and rest had become a nest of bondage, guilt, and weariness (Ezekiel 8-11). In righteous anger, God said he would leave his temple and allow Babylon to destroy it. But now, in the book’s final chapters, God gives Ezekiel a vision of a new temple where freedom, forgiveness, and rest are forever restored to God’s people. In great detail, God describes the measurements for almost every room and object in this new temple. God explains that the measurements should inspire God’s people to turn from the corruption of the past and live lives patterned after the freedom, forgiveness, and rest God intends to give them (Ezekiel 43:10-11). God specifically tells Ezekiel that the temple measurements are “laws” that God’s people are to “obey.” The measurements God gives Ezekiel aren’t blueprints for a building; they are ideals every Israelite should embody.

Almost all the numbers mentioned carry symbolic power. In Israel, the numbers 49 and 50 were important. Every 50 years, there was supposed to be a celebration called “Jubilee,” where slaves were set free, debts were canceled, and ancestral lands were returned (Leviticus 25:8-55). If you’re paying close attention, you’ll notice that the datings of Ezekiel’s prophecies add up to either 49 or 50 (Ezekiel 1:1-2; 40:1). And there are exactly 25 steps that lead up to the place in God’s temple where forgiveness was secured through sacrifice and 25 back down (Ezekiel 40:6, 22, 31, 49). The intentional dating of these prophecies and the number of steps in the temple should remind Israel that they are meant to be a community centered around freedom and forgiveness and encourage them to embody those values in the future.

Likewise, everything in Ezekiel’s temple is measured by a reed that is six “long cubits” long. A normal cubit was six handbreadths, but Ezekiel tells us this special “long cubit” is seven handbreadths long (Ezekiel 40:5). Seven is the same number of days in which God created the world, and it was on the seventh day that God rested (Genesis 2:1-2). The point is that everything in the temple is measured by God’s creative power and the hope of divinely sanctioned rest. These details are meant to encourage Israel to recommit themselves to God’s pattern of work and rest and so bring a new era of vitality and life to their community.

These are just a few of many references to sevens, twenty-fives, and fifties in Ezekiel’s temple. The point of all these numbers is to call Israel to turn back from their past sins and encourage them to obey. But the measurements are also promises. Ezekiel’s vision gives exiled Israel a symbolic mental picture of the world of freedom, forgiveness, and rest God wants to build for them. It also offers the hope that even though God has left his temple, one day God will return and create a place of freedom, forgiveness, and rest that will last forever (Ezekiel 43:1-9).

Where is the Gospel?

Israel failed to live up to the ideals of the temple vision. Their kingdom was not a place of freedom, forgiveness, and rest for God’s people but a place of bondage, guilt, and weariness. But Ezekiel’s vision would have given them hope. It represented a final chance to turn from their corruption, obey God’s commands, and receive the kingdom God wanted to give them. What would have given them even more hope was that no one was ever commanded to build Ezekiel’s temple. No building materials are listed, and no measurements for height are given. Ezekiel’s vision promises that a renewed temple and a restored kingdom of freedom and forgiveness would not rest on the efforts of any particular Israelite but on the actions of a better temple builder. But that temple builder is not Israel, but God. God built his true temple when he came to earth as the true Israelite, Jesus (John 2:19-21).

Unlike the Israelites of the past, Jesus perfectly lived the ideals of Ezekiel’s temple vision. Jesus used his power to give rest to those harassed by diseases and give freedom to those tormented by evil spiritual beings (Matthew 8:16). And Jesus used his last moments on earth to die as a sacrifice that would provide forgiveness for all God’s people (1 John 1:7). Jesus then rose from the dead, becoming Ezekiel’s restored temple in the flesh. Jesus’ resurrection inaugurated the kingdom of freedom, forgiveness, and rest that will last forever (John 18:36). 

We don’t have to wait for a building to finish construction. If you believe in Jesus, you are included right now in a Kingdom that provides rest, forgiveness for what you’ve done wrong, and freedom from the powers that have oppressed you.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who wants to provide his people a new temple. And may you see Jesus as our hope and guarantee of an eternity of rest, freedom, and forgiveness. "

And when we repent, God promises to forgive our past and spare us from the exile we would have otherwise earned.",Website,Ezekiel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The Israelites were chosen by God to be an example to the rest of the world of God’s goodness and justice. But Israel has abandoned that calling and created a society full of inequity, evil, and bloodshed. In a series of four prophecies, Ezekiel demonstrates that every level of Israelite society deserves to be exiled for their rebellion against God (Ezekiel 12:1-2). 

Ezekiel starts at the top. His first prophecy is for Israel’s king. In a series of prophetic signs, Ezekiel says Babylon will soon invade, pack up the king’s belongings, break down his walls, and escort him to Babylon, where he and those who defend him will die (Ezekiel 12:3-16). In another prophecy, Ezekiel eats a meal in a public square while violently shaking (Ezekiel 12:17-18). It’s another sign. Once the king is carried off, the survivors will eat every meal in anxiety and fear as their nation crumbles around them (Ezekiel 12:17-20). 

Moving down Israel’s social ladder, Ezekiel’s second prophecy is directed toward religious leaders who have denied God’s warnings of exile. For decades, the Jewish religious elite have dismissed any prophecies of political disaster (Ezekiel 13:21-22; 12:26-27). At the same time, influential women in Israel were selling magic charms that promised to ward off any coming destruction (Ezekiel 13:17–20). Unlike Ezekiel, the religious leaders and these influential women consistently prophesied peace in Israel despite its growing depravity and corruption (Ezekiel 13:10, 22). But God says all these presumptions will quickly be proven wrong (Ezekiel 12:13-15, 18). Israel’s prophets are liars (Ezekiel 13:1-7, 19, 23). The prophecies of false peace they’ve peddled are no better than putting a coat of plaster on a rotting wall (Ezekiel 13:10). God says he will pierce their false prophetic narratives with Babylonian swords and personally ensure they do not survive the coming exile (Ezekiel 13:8-16)

Nearer to the bottom of society, Ezekiel’s third prophecy is directed at Israel’s hypocritical clan leaders. While they frequently make a show of asking God for advice, most only ask God for his opinion after they have already consulted other gods. In doing so, Ezekiel says they have “given their hearts” to beings other than the God who chose them (Ezekiel 14:1-3). Ezekiel denounces their blended spirituality in hopes of winning Israel’s hearts back to the God who chose them (Ezekiel 14:4-6). If Israel’s clan leaders refuse to end their hypocrisy, Ezekiel says God will destroy both them and the prophets who pretend to give them answers (Ezekiel 14:7-11).  

Finally, Ezekiel addresses the average citizen of Israel who has followed their leaders’ evil example. Their leaders have so poisoned the people that there is no one left who can hold back the tide of national destruction and exile (Ezekiel 14:12-20). Soon, Babylon will descend and root out evil from Israel. While there will be some survivors, Ezekiel says they will continue in their evil stubbornness and prove to the world that Israel deserves their exile (Ezekiel 14:21-23). From top to bottom, Israel is corrupt, and God is right to destroy this  evil kingdom and send it into exile.

Where is the Gospel?

There is no one left in Israel who can stop their coming exile. Everyone is corrupt, from the king to his subjects. But the purpose of Ezekiel’s prophecies is to cause repentance. Ezekiel is only prophesying what will happen if Israel does not change course. Tragically, Israel did not repent, and just as he prophesied, Babylon destroyed it. 

Eventually, God sent another prophet to demonstrate the corruption of Israel’s society from top to bottom, named Jesus. Jesus claimed to be a king of a higher Kingdom than that of Rome (John 18:36-37). And Jesus told the religious leaders of his day that God sent him to judge them (John 9:39-41). Throughout his ministry, Jesus rebuked Israel’s religious leaders for their hypocrisy, injustice, and stubborn hearts. Like Ezekiel, he calls them plastered tombs that look good on the outside but are full of the bones of those they’ve victimized (Matthew 23:27-28). And to the average citizen of Israel, Jesus says he came not to bring a false narrative of peace but a sword that would divide evil fathers from their faithful sons and good mothers from their evil daughters (Matthew 10:34-36). Ezekiel prophesied that Israel’s evil would lead to their nation’s destruction, but Jesus prophesied something even more horrifying. He warned of an exile from God and his land that would last beyond death for anyone who persists in their evil (Luke 16:23). 

Ezekiel and Jesus’ prophecies demonstrate that we deserve exile, but they are not inevitable outcomes. When we hear these stark warnings from Jesus, they are mercies designed to provoke our repentance. When we repent and give our hearts to Jesus, he cleanses us from evil and destroys our rebellion. In his grace, he will forgive our past, and in his mercy, he will spare us from exile to be a people who demonstrate to the world God’s goodness and justice. Thankfully, God’s decision to exile those who reject him is always slow. And God is patiently waiting so rebellious people will have time to hear his message. God doesn’t want any of his people to be separated from him. That’s why he warns through prophets like Ezekiel and Jesus (2 Peter 3:9). So listen to Jesus’ warning, repent, and you will be saved from the coming exile.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who will inevitably destroy human corruption and evil by exiling it from his world. And may you see Jesus as the one who cleanses us of evil and makes us his people."

Ezekiel critiques the rulers of Israel for exploiting those in their care and causing Israel's exile. Uniquely, this chapter refers to these rulers as “shepherds.” The first king of Israel, David, was a shepherd before he ascended the throne (2 Samuel 5:2). God told him and all future kings to rule God’s people just as a shepherd gently cares for a flock. But in Ezekiel’s day, the shepherds had become predators. Ezekiel warns these bad rulers that God is coming to rescue his flock from their hands so his people can live with him again.

Ezekiel first details what Israel’s rulers have done and how God will respond to their crimes. They have led the people into idolatry, refused to care for the marginalized, and have not protected them from foreign armies. Since they used their position to exploit the people instead of serving them, God will remove the corrupt rulers and rescue his oppressed people (Ezekiel 34:1-10). Then God will step in to be the good shepherd his people need. He will care for the marginalized and gather those who have been scattered in exile (Ezekiel 34:11-16).

However, the issue of bad rulers was not the only problem facing God’s flock. Ezekiel also confronts the rich members of society for similar crimes. The elite have robbed the poor to feed themselves. Ezekiel compares them to selfish sheep fighting over limited food and muddying rivers so that those downstream cannot drink (Ezekiel 34:17-19). But there is hope for those who are victims of this wealthy class. Ezekiel says God will send a new David, a shepherd king, to provide equity between the rich sheep and the poor sheep (Ezekiel 34:20-24). This new David will unite Israel with God and ensure his people flourish in their homeland (Ezekiel 34:25-27). Under God’s chosen shepherd king, his people will no longer suffer from exile and bad leadership but will enjoy God’s nearness in a land of plenty forever (Ezekiel 34:28-31).

Where is the Gospel?

The problem of corrupt shepherds and evil sheep did not disappear with Israel’s rulers. Each generation of David’s dynasty failed to provide the equity and care Israel needed. But God promised he would shepherd his people and send a new David to bring them back to him and their flourishing homeland. That new David is Jesus.

Jesus is David’s descendant, and the good shepherd Ezekiel hoped for. God sent Jesus to care for his weak and wounded flock. Jesus condemned the religious elite of his day for exploiting God’s flock instead of serving them (Luke 11:37-46; Mark 11:17). He told the downtrodden that he had come to serve them and be their shepherd (Mathew 20:28; John 10:14-15). Like a good shepherd will care for his sheep's wounds and search for any lost sheep, Jesus healed the sick and welcomed the outcast everywhere he went. And like a good shepherd, Jesus gave his own life to protect his sheep (John 10:11). When enemies surrounded Jesus and his followers in a garden, Jesus let himself be captured so that his friends could get away (John 18:8-9). He was killed by corrupt shepherds, but he rose from the grave. All the way back in the book of Samuel, God promised David that one of his sons would reign in justice forever (2 Samuel 7:1-16). Jesus is David’s promised son and the eternal shepherd of God’s people. Jesus is both the king and shepherd who leads and restores his people back to God so that they can live with him forever (Revelation 7:17).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who cares for his people like a shepherd cares for his sheep. And may you see Jesus as the Good Shepherd who laid down his life for his people so that they can have life."

For the last ten years, Ezekiel has warned Israel that their rejection of God and lack of repentance would lead to the destruction of their homeland. And for the last twelve months, Jerusalem has been under attack from Babylon. Ezekiel’s prophecies about Jerusalem’s fall are about to come true. But in this dire moment, God recommissions Ezekiel as a prophet, not of destruction but of hope. 

Ten years ago, while sitting in an Israelite refugee camp in Babylon, God called Ezekiel to be like a watchman on a city wall. He was to look out and announce the coming threat of God’s judgment. The kingdom of Babylon was at hand, and God’s people were supposed to listen to Ezekiel’s warnings and repent (Ezekiel 3:16-27). Since that time, Ezekiel has been a faithful watchman, but Israel’s citizens haven’t heeded his warnings. As a result, their nation is about to succumb to Babylon’s invasion. God’s people in exile ask God how they can go on living when their families and hometowns are about to be destroyed (Ezekiel 33:10). And in response, God says he doesn’t take pleasure in anyone’s death. God loves to give life. And God will give life to dying Israel if they will only repent and return to God (Ezekiel 33:11). If they just listen to God’s recommissioned watchman, Ezekiel, God will forgive his people and thwart Babylon’s invasion (Ezekiel 33:11-16). But God’s people in exile don’t believe Ezekiel is really acting as God’s prophet and claim he’s being arbitrary. God promises judgment one moment and forgiveness the next. But pleading with them to accept his warning, Ezekiel says God has consistently been willing to forgive; the problem is that Israel has been consistently unwilling to repent (Ezekiel 33:17-20). 

Then, as if to prove that Ezekiel has been God’s prophet and watchman all along, a refugee from the besieged Jerusalem arrives in Babylon and declares that Jerusalem, Israel’s capital, has fallen (Ezekiel 33:21-22). As Ezekiel prophesied, God has finally judged Jerusalem, and sadly, the survivors are still unwilling to repent (Ezekiel 33:23-26). So God will remain consistent in his justice and allow their homeland to deteriorate even further (Ezekiel 33:27-29). All this should prove to the Israelites in exile that Ezekiel has been God’s prophet all along. They have been wrong in rejecting his prophecies as arbitrary stories and poems. Yet this should be good news, too. If Ezekiel’s been right about Israel’s destruction, then he’s also right that God will forgive and bring new life to Israel if they repent and listen to God’s watchman (Ezekiel 33:30-33).

Where is the Gospel?

Ezekiel’s message of hope to evil and idolatrous Israel is that God does not take pleasure in executing justice against the wicked (Ezekiel 33:11). God takes pleasure in giving and granting life. While God punished their hard-hearted and unrepentant sin by destroying their nation, God doesn’t want anyone to die. God is willing to forgive and restore their kingdom if they are willing to repent. This is why God sent another watchman and prophet to his people. His name was Jesus. Like Ezekiel, Jesus told Israel to repent because the Kingdom of God was at hand. The kingdom of forgiveness and restoration their ancestors rejected was now offered to them (Mark 1:15). 

From the moment of that kingdom announcement, Jesus’ ministry was not ultimately marked by condemnation and judgment but forgiveness and salvation (John 3:17). Even the supposed worst of society––prostitutes and traitors––saw in Jesus’ ministry their only hope for redemption (Luke 5:27-31). But like Ezekiel’s message, Jesus’ message was rejected by many. Those who refused to repent eventually crucified him. Yet, as Jesus was dying, a man dying next to him begged for forgiveness with his last breaths. Jesus told him that based on his death-row repentance, even he would enter God’s kingdom and live forever (Luke 23:42-43). Like a faithful watchman, Jesus died to tell people under threat of death and destruction that repentance leads to life and safety in his Kingdom. Ezekiel's prophecies of doom were proven right in Israel’s destruction, but Jesus’ prophecies of forgiveness and eternal life were proven right when God raised him from the dead. As Ezekiel said, God takes no pleasure in death. God wants all people to experience his forgiveness and eternal life. In Jesus, the Kingdom of God’s forgiveness has come. So, turn to Jesus because he always forgives those who call out to him.

God will purify and destroy all evil forever.",Website,Ezekiel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, has begun a military siege of Jerusalem (Ezekiel 24:1-2). Ezekiel and his fellow exiles in Babylon have just heard the news. For years, Ezekiel has been prophesying this day would arrive, and no one believed him. But now that the capital is under attack, God tells Ezekiel to deliver a parable, a story filled with symbols, explaining why Jerusalem is being destroyed (Ezekiel 24:3a).

The parable describes a cook preparing a great feast. First, the chef puts a cauldron over a fire. He puts water into the pot, followed by the best cuts of meat from the fattest animals (Ezekiel 24:3b-4). The chef stokes the fire and adds logs to the fire as the meat and bones are slowly boiled (Ezekiel 24:5). Earlier in Ezekiel’s ministry, the religious leaders of Jerusalem boasted that they were like choice meat in a cauldron (Ezekiel 11:1-3). Since they were God’s special people living in God’s promised city under the reign of God’s chosen royal bloodline, they presumed God would always protect them no matter what they did. But this parable reveals that if Jerusalem is a cauldron, and its leaders are meat, then God is the chef preparing the ingredients and using Babylon as his knife. Israel is not the nation God intends it to be. It is so full of evil, bloodshed, and idolatry that God will purify his people like a chef who removes impurities in food with boiling water and fire.

The parable continues. As the meat boils, the chef realizes that the meat is contaminated. Israel’s leaders are murderers, and the blood they’ve spilled is in the pot with them (Ezekiel 24:7). Piece by piece, God removes the tainted meat and throws the bloody broth on a nearby stone, saying if Israel’s leaders don’t even attempt to hide their bloodshed, he won’t either. He’ll leave the bloodstains where they are as a perpetual witness to Israel’s crimes and a vindication of what he is about to do (Ezekiel 24:8). The only way to remove Israel’s impurity and contamination is to burn it all up. So God adds logs to the fire. Once blazing, he chars the tainted meat and bones in the flames and melts the defiled cauldron among the coals (Ezekiel 24:9-12). Israel’s impurity and evil must be cleansed; their privileged position as God’s people will not protect them (Ezekiel 24:13-14).

God then gives Ezekiel another, much more costly, prophecy to deliver. God says Ezekiel’s beloved wife will soon die. Ezekiel’s prophecy is that he won’t have a funeral for his wife. Instead of engaging in his culture’s accepted rituals for death, he will grieve alone (Ezekiel 24:15-17). Later that day, Ezekiel’s wife dies, and he announces that there will be no public funeral (Ezekiel 24:18-19). He explains that the death of his wife is a sign that their beloved city and the families they long to return to will soon be destroyed and killed. And just as he will not have a funeral for his wife, Babylon’s siege will make it impossible to host funerals for their sons and daughters (Ezekiel 24:18-24). Now, all that’s left is to wait for news of Jerusalem’s fall (Ezekiel 24:25-26).

Where is the Gospel?

Ezekiel’s language is often graphic and sometimes hard to process. But the prophet who spoke most about the fires of God’s justice was God’s final prophet and only son, Jesus. In Jesus’ parables, the wealthy are burned (Luke 16:22-24). Those guilty of corrupting children are consigned to a place where fire never goes out (Mark 9:42-48). False religious leaders are thrown into furnaces (Matthew 13:42). Faithless servants are cast into eternal gloom (Matthew 25:30). Jesus even warns us that we should fear the God who can destroy evildoers in fire, like the chef in Ezekiel’s parable (Matthew 10:26-28). The intense language is a warning that God is committed to cleansing his world of evil and impure people, institutions, and nations. There is no room for presumption. God does not play favorites. 

But God has not just given us parables of his inevitable judgment of evil; he’s also given us a sign. Just as Ezekiel’s beloved wife died, God’s beloved son died as well. Just as Ezekiel did not mourn his wife’s death, God was silent the day his son was buried (Matthew 27:46). Jesus was “burned up” to clean the stains that humans have defiled the world with. Jesus' death is a sign that just as God has lost his beloved son, every beloved city built on bloodshed, injustice, and oppression will fall. We live in a world full of evil and injustice. And sometimes, even our churches seem filled with the same evil and corruption our world is filled with. And all of us wonder how long we need to wait for God to make things right. While no one knows the answer to that question, we do have a sign in Jesus’ death that soon, evil will be burned totally and completely, and no one will mourn its destruction (Revelation 19:1-3). Jesus’ death is a sign and promise that God will not always allow evil to reign and impure things to pollute his world. God will purify and destroy all evil forever.

In its first invasion of Israel, Babylon captured and deported many of Israel’s most influential citizens and put them in labor camps. These first exiles believe that God is unfairly punishing them for the sins their parent's generation committed. But Ezekiel says that’s not true (Ezekiel 18:1-2). God deals with each generation according to its actions (Ezekiel 18:3-4). Their lives are not predetermined by their forefathers’ sins. This generation of Israelites will live or die based on how they, as individuals, respond to God. 

Ezekiel illustrates this principle with a parable about a father, a son, and a grandson. A father faithfully obeys God’s laws, and God rewards him with a long life (Ezekiel 18:5-9). But his son is a violent man who breaks all of God’s laws and is met with an untimely death (Ezekiel 18:10-13). Now, the grandson has a choice to make. He has had a front-row seat to the actions and fates of his father and grandfather. Given the evidence, he should obey God’s laws in the hope of receiving God’s blessing and a long life (Ezekiel 18:14-18). The parable's point is simple: the current generation of Israelites is the grandson, and they must choose to obey God’s commands for themselves if they want their exile to end.

But Ezekiel’s disillusioned exiles are not convinced. To them, their exile is empirical proof that God punishes innocent people based on the sins of others (Ezekiel 18:19). But Ezekiel doubles down. They are not trapped by their ancestor’s sins, and their exile does not have to continue. God is calling them to obey because he forgives and rewards based on his people’s actions (Ezekiel 18:20-24).

But fundamentally, Ezekiel’s audience simply believes that God is capricious and unjust. No matter what they do, they believe God will punish them (Ezekiel 18:25-29). But again, Ezekiel says nothing could be further from the truth. God takes no pleasure in his people’s death (Ezekiel 18:30-32). But in order to live, they must first repent of their wrongdoing to obey God for themselves.

Where is the Gospel?

Like the exiles, many of us might feel trapped by generational patterns outside our control. We might be painfully aware that we are suffering the consequences of decisions our parents made and think that God is punishing us. But Ezekiel’s words should give us hope. God is fair. And God is always eager to forgive and offers new life for anyone willing to repent and obey. God doesn’t take pleasure in the death of his people. God’s ultimate desire is to give his people life. This desire is climactically shown in the person of Jesus. 

Like Ezekiel, Jesus called those who felt trapped in patterns of disobedience to repent and follow him to receive new life (Matthew 4:17). While Jesus lived, those caught up in chronic patterns of theft, adultery, and even demonic possession, found forgiveness and new life when they came to Jesus (Luke 19:1-10; John 4:1-20; Mark 9:17-29). But when confronted with a man born blind, Jesus’ closest followers asked him the same question the ancient Israelites asked Ezekiel. They wanted to know if this man was suffering because of the actions of his parents (John 9:1-2). Like Ezekiel, Jesus denies that this is the case. The man’s blindness wasn’t proof of God’s capriciousness; instead, the man’s blindness would prove God’s desire and power to restore and give life to his dying people (John 9:3). Jesus tells the man to go and bathe in a nearby pool. He obeys, and immediately, he is healed. (John 9:4-7). In all his miracles, Jesus proves that God desires to give life to all his people. 

You are not trapped by your past. Your parent’s sins do not define you. God is not holding onto generational grudges. Jesus has come to heal past wounds and grant you new life. So unlike Israel’s disillusioned exiles, and like the man born blind, obey Jesus and accept God’s gift of healing and new life.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who does not hold children responsible for the sins of their parents. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives new life to every generation."

Nebuchadnezzar’s successor Belshazzar has taken the throne. Belshazzar saw his father’s monstrous pride firsthand. He saw the statue his father built to his vanity, and his father go insane for claiming to be like God (Daniel 4:30-31). Belshazzar also saw his father’s sanity restored after he humbled himself before God (Daniel 4:34). But despite all this, Belshazzar’s first act in power is to plunder the royal treasury of artifacts from God’s temple (Daniel 5:2). He passes out goblets used by God’s priests to his concubines and guests, toasts to his own power, and gets drunk worshiping his own gods (Daniel 5:3-4).

In the middle of this idolatry and debauchery, a hand appears and writes four words on the wall: “Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin” (Daniel 5:5, 25). Despite promises of money and power, none of the king’s wise men understand what the words mean (Daniel 5:7-8). But the queen suggests Daniel be brought in because she’s heard “the spirit of the holy gods” lives in him (Daniel 5:11).

Daniel arrives and bluntly refuses the wealth Belshazzar offers in exchange for an interpretation (Daniel 5:17). He’s angry that Belshazzar has not learned anything from the pride and humbling of his father (Daniel 5:22-23). Daniel says that God has come to judge his proud heart (Daniel 5:24). The interpretation of the four words is complex. On one level, the four words relate to units of measuring weight: a mina, a shekel, and a half-shekel. But Daniel turns these nouns into similar-sounding verbs, interpreting them as ""numbered,"" ""weighed,"" and ""divided."" Daniel then adds a third level of meaning by providing a synonym or making a play on words. Belshazzar’s days are 

numbered, 

and the countdown is over; he has been 

weighed

 and found too light, and his kingdom will be 

divided

 between two nations: Media and Persia (and Persia, by the way, shares the same letters as the last word) (Daniel 5:26). While Belshazzar meaninglessly promotes Daniel, the writing is on the wall. Belshazzar is assassinated that same night, and Darius the Mede takes the kingdom (Daniel 5:30-31).

Where is the Gospel?

Belshazzar’s drunken party with God’s goblets was likely happening while Babylon was under attack from Media. It’s why Darius takes the throne so quickly, but it also serves to heighten the insanity of Belshazzar’s pride. He is literally drunk on power while his kingdom crumbles. If Nebuchadnezzar shows us what happens when we humble ourselves, Belshazzar shows us what happens when we don’t.

If we deny the God who holds our life, it will be taken from us. If we use our life to toast to our longevity, throw parties to our vanity, and get drunk on our invulnerability, Belshazzar’s fate will be ours. We will be weighed and found too light. This is frightening, but it is also good news. No arrogant power will ever last. All proud leaders will fall. Everyone who uses their power to mock God’s Kingdom and celebrate their own will be destroyed.

Jesus is coming to number, divide, and weigh the proud rulers of the world (Matthew 25:32, Revelation 19:11). Like Daniel, Jesus has been patient with human pride for generations (2 Peter 3:9). But the writing’s on the wall. Jesus is coming to find the arrogant wanting, to number the proud among the conquered, and to divide their kingdoms among the humble (Matthew 5:5). So don’t be like Belshazzar. Those who refuse to humble themselves before the invading army of God will fall. And those who reject the truth that Jesus’ humility leads to his resurrection will be dethroned. Humble yourself before the true King of the Universe. And soon, like Daniel and Jesus but unlike Belshazzar, you will be raised to a position of power at God’s right hand.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who weighs and finds the proud wanting. And may you see Jesus as the one who is coming soon to divide his Kingdom among the humble."

The last five chapters in Daniel contain a series of visions. Each is meant to encourage either Israel, Daniel, or one of the kings ruling from Babylon. In general, the message of each vision is that despite what it looks like, God is in control. He controls the kings, and he determines when kings rise, and kingdoms fall (Daniel 7:27).

The first vision describes the rise and fall of the Median, the Persian, and the Greek empires (Daniel 8:20-21). Once Greece falls, a number of other lesser kings will rise, only to give way to an even mightier unnamed king (Daniel 8:24). It seems these transfers of power are all political, but an angel assures Daniel that these empires are broken by no human hand (Daniel 8:25). Despite what it looks like, God is in control.

The second vision comes after Daniel spends a prolonged period of time in prayer, fasting, and reading the book of Jeremiah. Jeremiah prophesied that Israel’s sins would lead to her 70-year captivity in Babylon (Daniel 9:2). Daniel realizes that 70 years is up and repents on behalf of Israel with the expectation that God will rescue them (Daniel 9:18-19). But in response, an angel explains that Israel’s sins are so great that the 70 years will be extended to 70 “weeks” or 70 years time seven. Only then will Israel’s sins be forgiven (Daniel 9:24). Only then will Israel’s exile be over (Daniel 9:27).

The third vision introduces a terrifying being hovering over a river (Daniel 10:5-6). It puts Daniel to sleep and calls him a man deeply loved by God (Daniel 10:9, 18-19). The being then prophesies another series of conflicts. The first predicts again the downfall of Persia into the hands of Greece (Daniel 11:2). The second is a long account between the unnamed “kings of the North” and “kings of the South.” Special attention is given to a ruler who will one day rise from the North and desolate Jerusalem’s temple (Daniel 11:21, 31). But just as quickly as he rises, he falls, and no one is able to save him (Daniel 11:45). And on that same day, the dead will resurrect either to eternal glory or eternal shame (Daniel 12:2). The visions are layered with meaning, but the point is always the same: God is in control and no one else. From the movement of empires to the final destiny of souls, nothing is in God’s blind spot.

The being’s prophecies end, and two new beings show up by the river. One of them asks when all this will happen (Daniel 12:6). The first terrifying figure gives an intentionally vague answer—a time, times, and half a time (Daniel 12:7). When Daniel presses for more details, the first being tells him to stop and says that the answer is sealed until the end of time (Daniel 12:9).

Where is the Gospel?

Like Daniel, we want to know when all this will happen. We want a specific timeline telling us when we will stop suffering, evil kings will get their due, and God will raise his people from the dead. But the point of these dreams isn’t that we know history before it happens; the point is to trust the

 God 

who knows history before it happens. We don’t need to know a when, but a who. Despite what it looks like, and despite our inability to know the future, God is still in control, and we can trust him. In fact, those are the last words of the book of Daniel. Daniel is to rest from his questioning and worry because God will bring Israel into her promised national inheritance (Daniel 12:13). In 70 sevens, God will end her exile, he will forgive her sins, and he will inaugurate a new Kingdom of justice and resurrection in himself.

The next time 70 sevens is mentioned in Scripture is when Jesus tells Peter to forgive those who’ve sinned against him 70 times seven times (Matthew 18:22). Jesus is the King who brings an end to Israel’s exile because he is the one who forgives Israel’s sins. In Jesus, the accumulated weight of 70 times seven years of sin is finally repaid with forgiveness 70 times seven times. And like Daniel hoped, Jesus’ forgiveness begins a new Kingdom of resurrection life for all God’s people. Jesus’ exile in the grave completes Israel’s exile among the nations. And now God’s Kingdom finally reigns above all the empires of the world. God’s people are finally forgiven and given life forever.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who knows and controls all of history. And may you see Jesus as the one who has ended our exile and forgiven us 70 times seven times."

And just as Daniel rose in power while powerless in Babylon, Jesus rose in power from the grave.",Website,Daniel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The book of Daniel is about, among other things, God’s control over the movements of kings and nations. Daniel begins with God sending Israel into exile and into the hands of King Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 1:1-2). But Israel’s exile is a threat to God’s promises. God promised he would never abandon Israel and would use Israel to bless the world. But even in exile, God is in control. Among these exiles are Daniel (the son of a Judean politician) and three of his friends (Daniel 1:6). They are handpicked to enter into the king’s court (Daniel 1:3).

Daniel is probably a teenager. He’s separated from his parents, displaced in a new culture, and now lives in a massive city. Nebuchadnezzar takes advantage of Daniel’s disorientation and appoints experts to indoctrinate him and his friends in the culture, language, and literature of Babylon (Daniel 1:4). Nebuchadnezzar scrubs them of all ties to their Hebrew past and gives them new Babylonian names (Daniel 1:7). And under threat of death and promise of promotion, he demands Daniel and his friends abandon their Jewish laws about food (Daniel 1:5, 10). Daniel is being tested. Will he trust the God who sent him into exile, or will the power and promise of Babylon woo him? Daniel must decide if God is in charge or Nebuchadnezzar.

Daniel chooses obedience and faithfulness to God over allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel refuses to eat the king’s meat and wine—and proposes a test of his own (Daniel 1:8). Daniel will eat only vegetables and water for ten days while the king’s other indoctrinates eat the food of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 1:12-13). And in response to Daniel’s faith, God makes Daniel gain weight on a diet of vegetables and water. God then gives him a higher capacity than any of his peers to understand the culture and literature of Babylon (Daniel 1:15, 17). Daniel and his friends become blessings to the king’s court as his most trusted and competent advisors (Daniel 1:19-20). Nebuchadnezzar is not in charge, God is. Even in exile, God remains true to his promises and raises his people up to bless the world.

Where is the Gospel?

Like all empires and kings, Nebuchadnezzar’s power came from his ability to wield death. Nebuchadnezzar used exile to kill Daniel’s nation and executions to keep his captives compliant. But the book of Daniel shows the power of empires and kings is not more powerful than God’s promises. Despite what it looked like, God was always in control. And just as Daniel rose in power while powerless in Babylon, Jesus rose in power from his grave (Ephesians 1:19-21). And just as all the power of Babylon could not overturn God’s plan to preserve an exiled people and put his man in a seat of power, neither could the combined power of Rome nor the exile of the grave overturn God’s plan to raise Jesus from the dead and seat him in power (Acts 2:23-24). Daniel's ascent in exile and Jesus’ ascension from the grave both prove that God is always in control. And unlike the empires of the world, God’s power rests not in his ability to cause death but to undo death.

As the apostle Paul says, if God is for us, then who can be against us (Romans 8:31)? There is no hardship, persecution, global catastrophe, or national collapse that can separate us from God and his loving commitment towards his own (Romans 8:35). This doesn’t mean we won’t die or that we won’t suffer like Daniel in exile or Jesus on the cross. But it does mean there is no pain and no grave that can keep God’s people from conquering all things (Romans 8:36-37).

There are a lot of reasons to be afraid in this world. Nations are collapsing. Viruses are killing. Babylon has gone digital with its language. And if you’re watching this online, the algorithm that recommended this video is evidence that we’re caught in some new pagan metaverse. But the message of Daniel and Jesus is the same. Despite what it looks like, God is in control.

God gives Daniel a divine perspective on human evil in a nightmare. Like our own dreams, Daniel’s dream seems to be a confusing mix of images, places, and timelines. The main point of the dream, however, is clear: God sits on his throne above all human kings and kingdoms (Daniel 7:27).

The world’s kings are described as four mutant animals: a winged lion without a brain, a bear with ribs in its mouth, a leopard with four wings, and a beast with ten horns—each representing kingdoms ruled by proud kings (Daniel 7:17). These monster-kings show us just how horrific God sees human evil and proud empires. Remember the story of Nebuchadnezzar? God punished his arrogance and self-worship by turning him into a part-human, part-bird, part-ox monster for seven years (Daniel 4:28-33).

But while the earth is filled with what looks like monsters, in the clouds sit what looks like humans. A wise, white-haired Judge sits on his throne and is approached by a “son of man” riding with the clouds (Daniel 7:9, 13). The Judge has hundreds of thousands of attendants, is surrounded by holy fire, and is called the “Ancient of Days.” This is a vision of God with his people ruling over the monsters of the earth (Daniel 7:10).

But the son of man who comes with the clouds also has the power of God (Daniel 7:14). Throughout the Old Testament, only God comes with the clouds. In the Exodus story, God was the protective cloud for Israel as she fled Egypt (Exodus 13:21). The psalmist, reflecting on that story, calls Israel to worship the God who “makes the clouds his chariot” (Psalm 104:3). The Cloud-Rider is also God. It’s difficult to imagine God riding on the clouds towards himself, so Daniel asks an angel to interpret what he’s seeing (Daniel 7:15-16).

But the angel doesn’t clear up his confusion and instead adds another layer of meaning to the dream. The angel calls the “son of man” the “people of God” and says that they will approach the Ancient of Days and rule with God after the kingdom of the monsters ends (Daniel 7:18). For a time, the world and its beasts will win and oppress God’s people (Daniel 7:21, 25). But soon, after a period of persecution, God will raise up the son of man and the people of God (Daniel 7:26-27). Daniel wakes up feeling pale at the thought of inevitable suffering, but he’s confident that the beast’s rule will end.

Where is the Gospel?

The image of God riding the clouds towards himself, after a time of suffering and under the rule of beastly kings, is never fully interpreted until Jesus’ death and ascension. While on trial for crucifixion, Jesus quotes from Daniel 7 and says so himself: “I am… the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven” (Mark 14:62). Jesus is the Cloud-Rider. Jesus is the “Son of Man” who represents all sons and daughters of God.

Just like God’s people were crushed by the beast but then rose from the carnage in Daniel’s dream, Jesus is crushed by the beastly Roman empire and rises from his grave to take his seat at the right hand of the Ancient of Days (Matthew 24:30). And Jesus promises whoever remains faithful during the reign of the beasts will reign and be seated with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 2:6). We will be among the thousands upon thousands of holy ones serving and ruling with God around his throne (Daniel 7:10).

Daniel’s nightmare isn’t just descriptive of Babylon but of every nation and institution not ruled by the Ancient of Days. Around the world, we suffer, are persecuted, and ostracized for our fidelity to God alone. Jesus told us to expect this (Matthew 5:11). But the good news is that when we place our trust in the once-suffering, but now Cloud-Riding Son of Man, we rule with God 

now

, even while we are ruled over by monsters (Ephesians 2:6). In Jesus, our suffering becomes redemptive and death is a prelude to eternal life and power. The good news of Daniel 7 is that no matter how the world’s powers might crush followers of Jesus, they will never win over God’s people. Like Jesus, we will ride clouds, take our thrones over the monsters on the earth, and be with God forever (1 Thessalonians 4:17).

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who sits in power above all earthly kingdoms. And may you see Jesus as the one who raises us up to rule with him."

Jesus is the image that is more powerful than all the fury of an empire.",Website,Daniel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Daniel has just revealed Nebuchadnezzar's dream of a meteor crushing a giant statue (Daniel 2:31, 34). And Daniel warns the dream means that God’s Kingdom is coming to crush all other kingdoms (Daniel 2:44). But Nebuchadnezzar ignores the warning and builds a 90-foot tall statue (or image) of himself. He demands that all his politicians bow down and worship his image (Daniel 3:1, 5). Anyone who does not will be burned in his furnace (Daniel 3:6). Nebuchadnezzar has entirely missed the point of Daniel’s warning. His statue is a refusal to accept the outcome of the dream, and his demand for worship is a direct challenge to God.

But Daniel’s friends and fellow exiles, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refuse to bow to Nebuchadnezzar. By this time, they are high-ranking politicians in Babylon, and some native-born Babylonians are jealous. Taking advantage of the king’s vanity, they inform him that these three Jews refuse to worship him (Daniel 3:12). Nebuchadnezzar is furious and offers Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego an ultimatum, saying: “... if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. 

Then what god

 will be able to rescue you from my hand?” (Daniel 3:15).

Confident in their God’s power to save, they announce they would rather trust Him and die than bow to Nebuchadnezzar and live (Daniel 3:17-18). In a rage, Nebuchadnezzar overheats his furnace and throws them into it (Daniel 3:19-20). But someone “like a son of the gods'' walks with them in the fire and protects them (Daniel 3:25). In the fire, there is an “image” of God doing battle with Nebuchadnezzar. And the men faithful to God are saved by the image and not singed by the flames (Daniel 3:27).

In response, the king takes them from the fire, blesses their God, and approves of their decision not to bow to his image (Daniel 3:28). He then promotes them to even greater power, contrary to their conspirators’ plans. He threatens death to anyone who speaks against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego's God (Daniel 3:29-30).

Where is the Gospel?

Daniel 3 is a battle between images: the image of Nebuchadnezzar and the image of God. Ten different times Nebuchadnezzar’s statue is called an “image” (Daniel 3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18). Back then, kings marked their territory with images. As empires grew, kings placed images of themselves in conquered towns and at the edge of contested borders. Every time you saw the image, you knew who controlled the land. Nebuchadnezzar's golden image was the largest ever built. It was supposed to be the last word on who ruled the world. But the image of a son of God in the middle of Nebuchadnezzar’s flames and rage proves there is an image more powerful than Nebuchadnezzar's statue. King Nebuchadnezzar doesn’t control who lives and who dies—God does. And God’s image marked his territory right in the heart of Babylonian power, pride, and fury.

In the book of Hebrews, we’re told that the image of God, who protects from the fires of death, is Jesus. Jesus “is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact [image] of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word” (Hebrews 1:3). The true image of God is Jesus. And unlike Nebuchadnezzar, he does not demand we bow under threat of fiery furnaces. Instead, he enters the fiery furnace himself to rescue all who trust him. So bow to Jesus, the only image that can save us from the fire.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is more powerful than every image. And may you see Jesus as the only image of God who delivers and saves."

The new king Darius reorganizes the political system of Babylon into 120 provinces, with plans to make Daniel the prime minister over them (Daniel 6:1, 3). But some of the other rulers become jealous of Daniel’s influence in the new government and conspire to bring him down (Daniel 6:4-5).

They have no grounds to impeach Daniel, so they set a trap. Appealing to Darius’ vanity, they say that all his politicians have unanimously agreed to a new piece of legislation (Daniel 6:6). For 30 days, the kingdom will be required to pray in Darius’ name alone (Daniel 6:7a). Darius will be the only mediator between the gods and his people. And if anyone doesn’t obey, they will go through a “trial by lions” (Daniel 6:7b). This is necessary because it is impossible to prove in whose name you're praying. You need an “objective” test. If anyone is ever suspected of disloyalty, simply throw him in the lions’ den. If the lions don’t eat the suspect, he’s innocent. But if they do, he is “obviously” guilty. Flattered, Darius agrees without noticing the recently promoted Daniel is not among these conspirators (Daniel 6:8-9).

When Daniel hears about the decree, his first response is to pray—not to Darius, but towards Jerusalem (Daniel 6:10). The officials spy on Daniel’s prayer and immediately go to the king (Daniel 6:11-12). Their scheme has worked. Darius is trapped by his vanity and is powerless to acquit Daniel (Daniel 6:15). Daniel is thrown to the lions, a stone is rolled over his tomb, and the nation waits for the lions’ judgment (Daniel 6:16-17).

Darius can’t sleep; he’s both angry at his conspiratorial governors and anxious for Daniel (Daniel 6:18). But Daniel sleeps like a king of beasts because it is God and not a lion who is Daniel’s judge. Daniel was right to trust and pray to God (Daniel 2:23). Daniel is innocent, so God shuts the lions’ mouths and makes sure the conspirators’ trial backfires and Daniel is lifted from his tomb (Daniel 6:22-23). The king then throws the governors to their own rigged trial—and the lions find them guilty (Daniel 6:24). Darius then writes a new edict, calling the entire kingdom to worship Daniel’s God (Daniel 6:26-27).

Where is the Gospel?

Just like the jealous conspirators in Daniel, the jealous Pharisees want Jesus torn to shreds at the hands of the Romans (Matthew 26:3). The Pharisees set up a false trial that leads to a rigged verdict of “guilty” (Matthew 26:59). And a stone is rolled over Jesus’ tomb (Matthew 27:60). But the grave can only consume the guilty. And just like the lions could not swallow Daniel, death cannot consume Jesus. The trial by death backfires, and Jesus rises from the tomb because it is not possible for him to be judged by the grave (Acts 2:24).

It’s a significant detail that Daniel prayed “towards Jerusalem” (Daniel 6:10). Jerusalem was where God’s temple stood and where priests offered sacrifices so that the guilty could be declared innocent (Leviticus 16:30). But when Daniel was in Babylon, the temple was destroyed. There were no priests and no sacrifices. That means Daniel was praying towards and trusting in a future city, a future temple, a future priest, and a future sacrifice that would prove him innocent and vindicate him before his enemies. Daniel was praying towards Jesus, even if he didn’t know his name. It’s in Jesus’ name that both Daniel and we will find rescue from our accusers, be declared innocent, and see our oppressors come to justice (1 Timothy 2:5). It’s in Jesus’ name the grave will not find us guilty. And it’s in Jesus’ name the grave will never consume us.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who declares his people innocent. And may you see Jesus as the temple, priest, sacrifice, and the only name to whom you ever need to pray."

Hosea tells Israel that they have broken their marriage covenant with God (Hosea 4:1). Like the exchanging of vows at a wedding, Israel and God pledged themselves to each other and took certain oaths (Exodus 6:7). They represented a covenant that defined the way Israel would act in her marriage to God and established her as God’s representative to the world around her (Exodus 19:6). In that covenant Israel also agreed that if the people broke their vows, God could reject and punish them (Deuteronomy 28:15).

But Israel has forgotten and therefore broken the covenant explained in places like the Ten Commandments (Hosea 4:2). God lists the specific ways Israel has betrayed her marriage covenant, but the overarching problem is that the people lack knowledge (Hosea 4:6a). They have forgotten what it means to be God’s wife in the world. They have forgotten God and turned to false idols and false lovers (Hosea 4:12).

Because Israel has rejected her marriage covenant with God, God will reject them (Hosea 4:6b). While many of Hosea’s other prophecies will focus on specific punishments toward Israel’s land and people, this section identifies the worst possible punishment—separation from God. Hosea explains that since Israel has forgotten her covenant with God, it’s a sign they don’t know God at all (Hosea 5:4). God is well within his rights to walk away from their relationship (Hosea 5:6).

The God who used to be present and for Israel will now be away from and against her (Hosea 5:14). Until God’s bride stops forgetting and instead gains knowledge, nothing will change. Israel must recognize her guilt, seek God’s face, and desperately desire for him to return (Hosea 5:15). Only when she remembers her covenant to God, will she even know God again.

Where is the Gospel?

This link between not knowing God’s covenant and not knowing God himself escalates in the New Testament. The Pharisees, prided themselves in knowing and remember the laws of the covenant better than anyone, but they’re no better than the forgetful people of Israel in Hosea.

Jesus said if they really believed what Moses wrote in the covenant, they would believe in him because Moses’ words were ultimately about Jesus (John 5:47). But because they lacked true knowledge of the covenant, they couldn’t know who Jesus is. They could not see that he is God himself.

To know Jesus is to know the covenant. And to know the covenant is to know Jesus. That is because Jesus revealed and fulfilled God’s covenant to Israel on the cross. This is what Jesus called the new covenant of his blood (Matthew 26:28). Jesus has borne the consequences of covenant-breaking that our forgetfulness deserves. And like a faithful husband, he keeps the requirements of the covenant even when we forget them (Romans 8:4).

And when we do what God said in Hosea, when we acknowledge our guilt, seek his face, and earnestly desire him, we begin a new covenant bought by Jesus’ blood on the cross. As Jesus put it—repent and believe (Mark 1:15); when we love Jesus as a husband we will receive the blessings of being married to him. That is why knowing Jesus is knowing the covenant. Knowing Jesus is how we restore our fractured relationship with God (John 14:7).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who wants to be known in covenant with us. And that you will see Jesus as our husband who keeps the covenant so we can know him forever."

At this point in Hosea’s prophecies against Israel, we get to the heart of her spiritual adultery. Israel’s unfaithfulness to God was political.

That’s because Israel has set up kings and princes that God did not appoint (Hosea 8:4). They look to the armies of Egypt for safety (Hosea 10:13). They think a costly alliance with Assyria will save them from becoming their next target. Israel is compromising her allegiance to God alone in order to benefit from powerful governments (Hosea 8:9). And it seems to work. Israel is experiencing an economic boom that the people credit to their own political savvy. They think the false gods of their political allies are providing them with bountiful farms and healthy wombs (Hosea 10:1). But God says disaster is hovering over Israel like a bird of prey (Hosea 8:1). The reality is that God has been gracious despite their disobedience; unlike them, he’s faithful to his covenant.

Israel can’t see the problem. They insist that they have kept their relationship with God intact (Hosea 8:2). They still keep all the feasts and sacrifices God commanded in the law. But the truth is that Israel just keeps God’s wedding ring on her finger while sleeping with other men (Hosea 9:1). The people have so enmeshed politics with their worship of God that they can’t see how scandalous their actions are. They have deposed God as their king, but have kept up the appearance of their religious obedience to ease their conscience.

Since Israel has so severely broken her marriage with God, God will remove the blessings of bountiful farms and healthy wombs that Israel has been crediting to the false gods of her political allies (Hosea 9:11). The governments the people trusted will be their downfall (Hosea 9:6). The foreign powers they thought would save Israel will be the forces God uses to drag them into exile (Hosea 9:3). And worse, God will no longer accept their sacrifices (Hosea 9:4). The one place they could have gone for help will be taken from them (Hosea 10:2). And in suicidal despair Israel will ask the mountains to crush them (Hosea 10:8).

Where is the Gospel?

Israel still had this problem in Jesus’ day. Some, like the Sadducees, gained political power by enmeshing themselves with Rome. Others, like the zealots, amassed large followings by promising violent coups against the Romans in the name of God. One of these insurrectionists was named Barabbas (Luke 23:18-19). The crowds at Jesus’ trial chose to release him instead of Jesus. They chose a political leader instead of their God (Luke 23:25). They chose a worldly power to save them and sent Jesus off to the cross.

It’s no wonder Jesus quotes Hosea’s words to a group of mourning women as he approaches the cross (Luke 23:27-28). The same destruction that Hosea prophesied is coming to them (Luke 23:30). In fact, every civilization is under the same threat. Everyone in the world trusts in the political strength of their leaders, parties, and armies more than God—and so will soon come to an end.

But the good news is that Jesus pronounced this punishment on his way to bear it for us. Jesus was sentenced to die on the cross while the insurrectionist and murderer was set free. This can be your story too. When we trust our ultimate King Jesus and refuse to put our trust in earthly rulers and political leaders, even insurrectionists like us can be set free.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see God as the king who demands your allegiance. And may you see Jesus as the king who died to buy our allegiance by his love and self-sacrifice."

In Hosea’s final prophecies, the prophet compares Israel’s exodus from Egypt to their current situation. Hosea reminds Israel that it was God’s great love that moved him to rescue her out of Egypt (Hosea 11:1). Like a loving husband, God wrapped Israel up in his arms and led her with kindness and affection (Hosea 11:4). But the more he loved his people, the more they went away from him (Hosea 11:2).

Like Israel in the wilderness, Israel in Hosea’s day built idols and golden calves. But Hosea says that Israel has not just sacrificed animals to their idols, but their own children (Hosea 13:2). So while Israel was made to wander in the wilderness for 40 years for their disobedience, God will make them wander in Assyrian exile for their own rebellion (Hosea 11:5). In the Exodus, the plagues attacked Israel’s enemies and paved the way for their escape. But this time, the plagues will drive God’s people out of their homeland and come against Israel herself.

God has had enough (Hosea 13:11). He removes all compassion from his eyes and calls upon death, the plagues, and the grave to do their worst, saying, “Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O grave, is your destruction?” (Hosea 13:14). But God will not wipe Israel out for good (Hosea 11:9). The very thought makes God’s own heart recoil within himself (Hosea 11:8). So after Israel has been exiled, God will call those who remain to return (Hosea 11:10). Hosea ends his book by pleading with Israel to repent and return to the Lord (Hosea 14:2). They are to ask God for forgiveness and to trust him alone for salvation (Hosea 14:3).

Where is the Gospel?

In his account of Jesus, Matthew shows Jesus repeating the Exodus story as well. He even quotes from today’s passage in Hosea to make the point (Matthew 2:15). But instead of disobeying and building idols, Jesus perfectly obeyed God when he came out of Egypt. Jesus is the nation of Israel as she was supposed to be—the Son of God who pleases his Father (Matthew 3:17). But when the plagues came, they did not come for God’s enemies or God’s people. They came for God himself. Jesus bore the plagues of our punishment on the cross.

The terrifying curse God speaks to Hosea is flipped on its head. The apostle Paul quotes Hosea and says death, the plagues, and the grave have no power over those who trust in Jesus. He writes, “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?” (1 Corinthians 15:55). What was a curse against us, is now a taunt against the grave itself. In Jesus, “Death has been swallowed up in victory” (1 Corinthians 15:54). Now, we who repent and trust Jesus alone are saved from our coming death.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who won’t allow our punishment to have the final word. And may you see Jesus as the one who bore our punishment and allows life to be his final word over us."

Hosea has married an adulterous woman, Gomer. It’s a wake-up call and a warning for Israel. Israel needs to wake up to the reality of her religious whoring—or risk God refusing to call Israel his wife anymore (Hosea 2:2-3).

Israel is called unfaithful because she has credited God’s provision of good harvests and good health to a false god named Baal (Hosea 2:8). She’s like a wife who kisses another man for flowers bought by her husband. Israel has even subverted observances like the Sabbath to show her love for Baal (Hosea 2:11). So, God says he will punish Israel (Hosea 2:13a). He will remove them from their land and from the temple, the place of his presence. Israel will no longer be able to approach God because God will leave them.

But for the second time in Hosea, God extends hope to his adulterous bride. He says that he will allure his people back to himself (Hosea 2:14). God will speak tenderly to his people so that they will love him again. Just as a couple may reenact their honeymoon and renew their vows, God will restore their relationship in the wilderness—the same place he took Israel after he rescued her from Pharoah (Hosea 2:15). Israel will once again call God her husband and will never again confuse his provision with Baal’s (Hosea 2:16). God will renew his marriage vows with her, bring her back home, and live with her forever in peace and love (Hosea 2:19).

This forgiveness and reconciliation is then acted out by Hosea and his adulterous wife (Hosea 3:1). Gomer fell back into her promiscuous ways, so Hosea finds her, pays her new captor’s ransom fee, and delivers her again (Hosea 3:2). Hosea then explains to Gomer that they will not be sexually intimate for a time (Hosea 3:3). It’s another living picture of Israel and God’s relationship. It’s a prophetic symbol of the spiritual distance Israel must go through while they are without their temple and without access to God. Hosea’s marriage shows Israel that God is taking her into the wilderness where there will be a time of waiting, but also a coming time of renewal.

Where is the Gospel?

Israel’s adultery persisted into Jesus’ day. Like Hosea’s audience, Jesus spoke to the religious leaders who subverted observances like the Sabbath into services for other lovers. They weren’t serving the false god Baal, but they were obeying God out of love for the observance itself (Mark 2:27). They loved the ritual, but not the God who commanded it.

And Jesus pronounced similar judgments on Israel’s temple for this spiritual adultery, just as Hosea did. Jesus said the temple would be destroyed (Matthew 24:2). Like Hosea, Jesus even provides a living picture of this destruction when he overturned tables and drove out money changers from within the temple’s walls (Matthew 21:12).

But Jesus is also the good husband Hosea prefigured and promised. In Jesus’ day, people flocked to the wilderness to meet their promised groom (Matthew 3:1). He taught that the temple would no longer be the place people would come to meet God (John 4:21). Instead, we would meet God in Jesus. He would be our new temple (John 2:21). Throughout his life, Jesus wooed those needy like Gomer to himself (Luke 7:37). And in his death he spoke more tenderly to us than any other lover could (John 15:13). At the cost of his life, Jesus ransomed his bride from her false lovers and captors (Matthew 20:28).

And in his resurrection, we have access to God even in the wilderness. There is no more spiritual distance or season of wandering. Through his Spirit, Jesus comes to dwell in us (John 14:23). He makes us his temple, turning our wilderness of waiting into the place of renewal.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who longs for intimacy with us. And that you will see Jesus as the one who allures us to himself at the redemption price of his body on the cross."

Israel is running to everything but God. Hosea pleads with the people of Israel to repent by reminding them of their wedding day with God (Hosea 6:1). On their third day at Mt. Sinai, God appeared and was present with his people (Exodus 19:16). So Hosea says that those who repent, though they’ve been struck down, will live near God once again (Hosea 6:2).

But his calls receive no response. Any show of love toward God that Israel can muster, dries up faster than morning dew (Hosea 6:4). Instead of loving God from the heart, Israel tries to pay him off with sacrifices. Even her religion was adulterous. So Hosea tells the people plainly that God desires mercy, not sacrifice (Hosea 6:6).

Israel disregards Hosea’s warnings and continues to break her marriage covenant by giving her heart to others. Instead of trusting God for their protection and provision, the people of Israel have entered into adulterous relationships with other nations and their false gods (Hosea 7:8). Like a serial adulterer, they run from affair to affair.

When they feel threatened by the powerful nation of Assyria to their north, they run south to their old enemies in Egypt for protection. But when Egypt doesn’t provide the security they need, they grovel before Assyria and try to pay them off with tributes. Hosea calls them a senseless bird, flying here and there with no reason (Hosea 7:11). They are flying to everyone except God.

But, like many illicit affairs these adulterous relationships implode. When Israel depends on the weapons of Egypt, they backfire (Hosea 7:16). And when she pays for Assyria’s help, she has to pillage her own people to cover the cost (Hosea 6:9). Israel is trying everything in her own power to fix her problems. She runs after anything religious or political to keep her safe—anything other than God himself.

Where is the Gospel?

In Jesus’ day, people also ran to everything but God. The religious leaders in particular ran to religious observance and political affiliations instead of Jesus. Once, when Jesus was eating with tax-collectors and sinners, the religious leaders asked why he ate with people they saw as undeserving (Matthew 9:10). Jesus responds with Hosea’s words: “‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Matthew 9:13).

Jesus is both indicting these religious leaders and commending these sinners. First, he charges the religious leaders with the same spiritual adultery as Israel in Hosea’s day. They fly to their religious merits instead of the God who was right in front of them. And second, Jesus commends the sinners around the table for seeking him out and repenting like Hosea pleaded with Israel to do. Jesus didn’t come to save those who thought they didn’t need saving (Matthew 9:12). He didn’t come for those who fly to their own good works, institutions, or political affiliations. He came for those who will fly to him (Matthew 11:28).

When we cling to Jesus as our husband in covenant love, there is nothing else we need to bring. There are no offerings, and no sacrifices needed because God’s mercy has been shown through Jesus’ death on the cross. He became the sacrifice Israel never made. Jesus fled to God, even in death.

And as Hosea prophesied, on the third day God raised from the dead the one who was faithful to him (Hosea 6:2; 1 Corinthians 15:4). Jesus rose from the dead to show that he is the only power that rescues us from the dangers and threats around us (Ephesians 1:21). It seems easier to trust politics and religion to make us feel safe and right with God. But in Jesus’ mercy and sacrifice we never need to run anywhere else.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who desires our love more than our sacrifices. And may you see Jesus as the one who made the ultimate sacrifice of love to bring us back into our covenant marriage with him."

Jeremiah is God’s prophet to the dying nation of Judah. When Judah first became a kingdom, God promised he would always give prophets to his people to guide them. These prophets would have God’s words in their mouths, and they would lead and guide God’s people (Deuteronomy 18:14-18). Jeremiah is one of Judah’s last prophets who counseled Judah’s last kings. Over 40 years, Jeremiah has one clear message. Judah has grievously insulted, disobeyed, and rejected their God and, as a result, should expect God’s judgment in the form of national exile. Instead of digging in their heels and trying to protect what was left of their nation, Judah must surrender their kingdom and become slaves to the country of Babylon (Jeremiah 1:1-3).

As with most prophets in the Bible, God approaches Jeremiah and commissions him to this task. God tells him that before he was born, God chose him to deliver these oracles of destruction to Judah and all proud nations of the world (Jeremiah 1:4-5). Jeremiah feels afraid and unqualified (Jeremiah 1:6). God says he will provide all the qualifications he needs. He will be with and protect Jeremiah from those who hate his message and put his words in Jeremiah’s mouth (Jeremiah 1:7-9). When Jeremiah says that a nation will be uprooted, torn down, destroyed, or overthrown, it will happen. And when he prophecies that kingdoms will be rebuilt and replanted, that will come to pass as well (Jeremiah 1:10). From this moment on, Jeremiah is God’s commissioned spokesman—and nations will rise and fall by their response to God’s words in Jeremiah’s mouth. 

Jeremiah then sees two visions. The first is of an almond branch, and it’s meant to comfort Jeremiah. In Hebrew, the words “almond” and “watch over” are very similar. The image of an almond branch is a promise that God is watching over Jeremiah to ensure that whatever Jeremiah says will come to pass (Jeremiah 1:11-12). The second vision is of a giant boiling pot on a world map that spills its contents on nations to the south. It is a mental picture of Jeremiah’s verbal message. A force from the north is coming like a flood to wipe away Judah and its capital, Jerusalem, for insulting, disobeying, and rejecting their God (Jeremiah 1:13-16). 

God then turns to Jeremiah and tells him to get ready for his life’s mission to begin (Jeremiah 1:17). God tells Jeremiah he will be under constant threat. His message of surrender will be seen as treason. He will be put on trial. Almost everyone will hate his prophecies. But as Jerusalem burns, Jeremiah will be a fortified city. No weapon or conspiracy against him will succeed because God will be with him always (Jeremiah 1:18-19).

Where is the Gospel?

Jeremiah is God’s chosen prophet. He’s been commissioned to convince Judah to accept their deserved exile. But Jeremiah has also been commissioned to point beyond Judah’s national death to the day God would rebuild and replant his people and kingdom (Jeremiah 1:10). Sadly, Jeremiah died before he could see Judah restored. God’s people waited almost 400 years before God sent his final prophet, Jesus, to begin the restoration spoken by Jeremiah. 

Like Jeremiah, Jesus was God’s commissioned prophet of exile and restoration. God’s words were in Jesus’ mouth (John 12:49). But more than Jeremiah, we’re told that Jesus was God’s words embodied. Whatever Jesus said came to pass (John 1:14). Like Jeremiah, he prophesied that before his people would be restored, they needed to first repent of their disobedience and rejection of God by accepting death (Matthew 10:38-39). God’s people must stop digging in their heels and die to their disobedience so that they can be freed, rebuilt, and restored. 

But our deserved death was graciously borne by Jesus. Throughout his life, Jesus repeatedly prophesied his death, promising that through it, God’s people would enter an era of restoration and receive an eternal kingdom (Mark 8:31-35; John 11:25). So Jesus willingly died on a cross. The boiling pot of Rome uprooted, tore down, destroyed, and killed Jesus’ body. But in the grave, God watched over his prophet, and three days later, he restored him to life. Jesus was torn down and raised so that anyone who repents and accepts Jesus’ death and exile can enter God’s rebuilt and resurrected Kingdom forever (Matthew 16:24). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who both destroys and rebuilds. And may you see Jesus as the one who died and rose so that we might die and rise with him."

Israel has been destroyed by Babylon. The book of Lamentations is a series of five anonymous acrostic poems that lament Babylon’s invasion and the ruin of Israel. They are an alphabetical memorial of Jerusalem’s sorrows, an A-Z accounting of her devastation. 

In chapter 1, Jerusalem is personified as a grieving widow who has fallen from grace, honor, and privilege (Lamentations 1:1). Her friends, husband, and lovers have either abandoned or betrayed her (Lamentations 1:2). Worse, God, who once liberated her from slavery and gave her rest in her own land, has enslaved his bride to hard labor under new foreign masters (Lamentations 1:3). This exile, however, is Lady Jerusalem’s fault (Lamentations 1:5). And she knows it.

She remembers all the privileges and gifts that God once gave her—and how, like a thankless bride, she let other lovers and lords “enter” her most sacred place and steal all the precious things God gave (Lamentations 1:7-10). The Babylonians publicly expose Lady Jerusalem for her opportunism, idolatry, and immorality. But naked, she demands that God look at her (Lamentations 1:9b). She wants God to see her destitution (Lamentations 1:11). And she wants all reading to see both her sorrow and the unrelenting ferocity of God’s divine justice (Lamentations 1:12-13). Lady Jerusalem accepts her guilt but refuses to accept her suffering as God’s final word to her (Lamentations 1:18). She begs God to see her pain and respond with justice against her enemies (Lamentations 1:20-22).

But God does not respond. Instead, a second poem shifts to the perspective of the author, who reiterates that all Jerusalem’s sufferings come from God’s hand. Twenty-eight verbs are used to describe God’s justice. God swallows, breaks, cuts, burns, kills, lays waste, disowns, scorns, and sinks Jerusalem for her atrocities (Lamentations 2:1-9). God’s justice is total and Israel is silent in her guilt (Lamentations 2:10). 

Breaking the silence, the author weeps for Lady Jerusalem and vomits as he sees the justice, even faithfulness, in God’s actions (Lamentations 2:11-17). He begs Jerusalem to end her silence and cry to the same God who has afflicted her, if not for her own sake then for her starving children (Lamentations 2:18-19). Numb, the only prayer Lady Jerusalem can ask is for God to look and consider. She pleads for him to look at the cannibalism mothers have been reduced to, to look at the terror and human cost of God’s justice, and to consider if God really desires his judgment to be his last action towards his people (Lamentations 2:20-22). 

Where is the Gospel?

The only hope for guilty Israel is that the same God who judges her guilty will yet show her compassion. Early in Israel’s history God entered into a special relationship with Israel. He promised to provide a kingdom and a land in his presence, and Israel promised to listen to and obey God’s laws in return (Exodus 24:7). Israel signed her name to this covenant and accepted a list of consequences or “curses'' if she failed (Deuteronomy 28:15-68). With excruciating detail, Lamentations describes the curses Israel signed her name to. Israel knows God’s justice was good to invite the Babylonians. But Israel also knows if God is good, then his judgment must eventually end. The people know that if God is good, judgment can’t be his last word to his chosen people, even if they have not held up their end of the covenant. 

And it wasn’t. God sent his last word to his people in Jesus. He became like Israel in her exile. Jesus was abandoned by his friends, stripped naked and publicly exposed at the cruel hands of imperial judgment (John 19:23). Jesus was defiled and made destitute as a living representative of Israel’s guilt (John 1:29). And under the unrelenting ferocity of God’s divine justice, God does not respond when his own son cries out in pain (Matthew 27:46). But Jesus did all of this because he knew if God’s justice condemned him, God’s justice must then show mercy to his exonerated people (John 18:36). 

In Jesus, our guilt is paid for. In Jesus, the curses have been exhausted. In Jesus, we have been given his innocence (Romans 5:1). God’s justice now treats us not as a cheating spouse but as a beloved bride. We now have a home in God. God’s last word to his people is not the verdict of “guilty.” God’s last word to his people is not judgment. God’s last word, even to people who have not held up their end of the covenant, is the restoring and resurrecting life of Jesus. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is just. And may you see Jesus as the one who receives God’s justice for our guilt so that God’s promises can come true."

The lover’s song has just reached its crescendo with the consummation of their marriage (Song of Songs 4:16). The bride seems to fall asleep on her marriage bed and is awakened by the sound of her husband knocking at the door (Song of Songs 5:2). As he jiggles the latch, the woman jumps from the bed and flings open the door (Song of Songs 5:4). 

But, to her astonishment, her husband has disappeared (Song of Songs 5:6). For the second time in the song, her husband is nowhere to be found (Song of Songs 3:1). Her heart fails (Song of Songs 5:6b), she is abused in the streets (Song of Songs 5:7), and even her bridesmaids question if her husband is really as special as she claims (Song of Songs 5:9). 

These accusations against her beloved cause the bride to burst into song, defending the beauty and distinction of her groom (Song of Songs 5:10). In her lover's absence she launches one of the longest songs about the loveliness of her husband. The song doesn’t defend the husband’s absence based on what he has done for her in the past, but simply based on who he is. 

Her friends soften, asking where he has gone, even offering to help look for him. (Song of Songs 6:1). 

Yet, though the bride doesn’t know where he is, she knows he still loves her. She says he is still in the garden, the song’s common metaphor for the place where the lovers can be intimate (Song of Songs 6:2). She renews her vows in front of the doubting daughters saying, “I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine” (Song of Songs 6:3).

Where is the Gospel?

The Christian life is filled with moments like these. Sometimes, at the height of our nearness to God, we look up and it seems like he is far from us again (Psalm 13:1). 

Our hearts fail and our doubts win. The voices around us seem to say, “If your God is as good as you claim he is, this wouldn’t be happening to you.” 

But we know God is not like that, because Jesus is not like that. 

No matter what happens, we can praise the beauty, distinction, goodness, character, and faithfulness of Jesus (Psalm 13:5-6). We do this, not by listing the physical attributes of an earthly groom, but by unashamedly naming the unshakeable attributes of our heavenly husband (Colossians 3:1). 

Our trust in God is not based on circumstances, but on Jesus’ character. When our doubts tell us God is far, untrustworthy, and compassionless, we can confidently respond that Jesus is not like that.

Jesus is more trustworthy than our most trusted senses or sources (Hebrews 6:18). Jesus loves us more than any spouse, friend, or family member ever could (Romans 5:7-8). Jesus is closer to us than the accusers in our ears or the brokenness in our hearts (Psalm 34:18). 

While we have infinite ways to prove Jesus is this way through his humble birth, love-filled life, and sacrificial death, we can celebrate the character of Jesus based not only on what he has done, but on who he is. 

The good news is that God is good. 

Just as the bride repeated her wedding vows, we can repeat Jesus’ promise to us, “Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (Matthew 28:20). No matter where we go, Jesus is with us. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who is near even when he feels far. And that you would see Jesus as our beautiful husband in whom we can stake our trust."

The bride is in bed, likely waking from a dream. She looks over to where her beloved should be sleeping, only to find that he is gone (Song of Songs 3:1). 

Immediately, she leaps out of bed, runs out of the house, and starts searching for him frantically in the city streets (Song of Songs 3:2). But twice, we hear this disheartening refrain, “I looked for him but did not find him.” 

She goes to the watchmen, the guards of the city, whose job it is to see who is roaming the streets and going in and out (Song of Songs 3:3). But they are no help. She runs past them and finally finds her groom (Song of Songs 3:4a). She holds him and will not let go until they are back in bed together (Song of Songs 3:4b). 

As before in the song, at the height of passion, the bride turns to her unmarried bridesmaids and warns them not to give themselves over to sexual intimacy until they too are married (Song of Songs 3:5). 

And the next song we hear is about the bride’s wedding (Song of Songs 3:11). 

She compares her husband, walking down the aisle, to the grandest army of the grandest king of Israel: Solomon (Song of Songs 3:7). The groom is like Solomon who rides in a chariot made out of the most luxurious materials (Song of Songs 3:9-10). 

Then, almost as if they are his vows, the groom gushes over the beauty of his bride (Song of Songs 4:1a). He praises her beauty from head to toe (Song of Songs 4:1b). He concludes that she is altogether beautiful with not one single flaw (Song of Songs 4:7). 

The song builds to its highest point when both husband and wife invite each other to finally consummate their marriage (Song of Songs 4:16). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The bride’s frantic nighttime search for her absent husband is a picture of how our hearts feel when those we love deepest are far away from us. We will do anything to hunt them down and be with them again. 

Somewhat surprisingly, Jesus seems to quote the bride while talking to the crowds in Jerusalem about his identity and authority. He says, “You will look for me, but you will not find me” (John 7:34). He is talking about how, after his resurrection, he will ascend back to heaven and his disciples will miss him (John 7:33). 

Like the bride in the streets, we are longing and waiting for Jesus to return (Matthew 25:6). 

But Jesus does something for us that the bride’s husband did not do. He gives us the presence of God in the Holy Spirit (John 16:7). Just as the bride holds onto the groom, the Holy Spirit holds onto us until he brings us home to be with Jesus our groom (Ephesians 1:13-14). 

Jesus will return with far more splendor than Solomon or any king (Matthew 12:42). 

His return will be like a wedding day (Revelation 21:2). He will be the groom and we will be the bride (Revelation 19:7). Jesus will look at us from head to toe, through heart and soul, and find no flaw in us (Revelation 19:8). We will be dressed, not in a wedding gown of our own making, but in the beauty and goodness of Jesus himself, who bought our spotless dress through his death on the cross (Ephesians 5:25-26). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who comes to his searching bride. And that you would see Jesus as the coming groom who has made us perfectly beautiful."

The title, Song of Songs, is a Hebrew way of saying the greatest song—just as king of kings means the greatest king (Song of Songs 1:1). 

Song of Songs is erotic love poetry describing the passion shared between a husband and a wife, along with the sexual intimacy that rightly accompanies it. This type of literature can seem out of character for the Bible and might make you blush when you read it. But it is so valuable because it also reveals much about our intimacy with God. 

Other religions of that day actually fused physical intimacy with divine experience in what are known as fertility cults. Sex with prostitutes filled the rooms of pagan temples (1 Corinthians 6:15). Sexual intimacy was one way they encountered their gods. But our Song is after something different.

The Song opens with a woman speaking to her lover about her aching desire for him. She praises his kisses and his love (Song of Songs 1:2). She gushes over the fragrant oils with which he has covered himself (Song of Songs 1:3). And she begs him to bring her into his chambers. 

But surprisingly, we notice that she is speaking to no ordinary man, but the king (Song of Songs 1:4a). The title “king” is probably a metaphor for how highly the woman esteems her lover. He may only be a farmer, but to her, he is like a king. 

Next, we are introduced to another group of voices. A small crowd of anonymous spectators affirm the woman’s praise and love of the man (Song of Songs 1:4b). The presence of this chorus of voices would be strange in the middle of an intimate conversation. That is why it's likely the opening verses describe a wedding ceremony and we are hearing the vows, along with the accompanying affirmation song of the bridesmaids. 

The bride takes the song back over. She talks about how years of working in the fields have made her skin darker, a sign of low social status in that day (Song of Songs 1:6). But the bride does not see this as a flaw. Instead, she compares her skin to the curtains that surround God’s presence in the temple (Song of Songs 1:5). She feels no shame about her appearance because she is loved by her king. 

Where is the Gospel? 

The bride’s opening song uses language normally reserved to talk about God’s temple (Exodus 30:37). She is comparing her expected intimacy with the groom to the joy and satisfaction of being in God’s presence in the temple (Psalm 4:7). 

Right up front, the greatest Song challenges us to meditate on the links between God’s presence and sexual desire and intimacy (1 Corinthians 6:13). 

It points to our greatest satisfaction—the presence of God (Psalm 84:2). This satisfaction is not mediated by a physical sexual encounter. Rather, the love found in God’s presence eclipses sexual satisfaction, like the glory of a king would eclipse that of a farmer. 

It’s no wonder Jesus calls us his bride and himself our groom (Matthew 9:15). He is the groom who is also the king, our husband who is also our God. He loves us in far greater ways than any other person ever could, by pouring out the better wine of his blood and the better anointing of his Spirit to bring shameful and lowly people like us into the chamber of his satisfying presence (Romans 5:8). 

Our heavenly husband’s presence is not like going to the temple. It is better. We are his temple. The Holy Spirit dwells in us, providing constant intimacy with God. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God whose presence is more satisfying than all physical intimacy. And that you will see Jesus as the groom who loves you, his bride, so intimately that he laid down his life."

Uncontainable desire swells through the end of the Song of Songs. Once again the bride speaks of her desire to give herself physically to the groom in their garden of love (Song of Songs 7:12). 

But her desire is frustrated by the constraints of culture. She laments that she can’t show public displays of affection to her beloved (Song of Songs 8:1b). Apparently it isn’t acceptable for her to even give him a kiss on the cheek like she can to one of her brothers (Song of Songs 8:1a). 

So her desires are frustrated. This craving for-—yet lack of—fulfillment is highlighted by the bride’s repeated warning to the daughters of Jerusalem: “Do not awaken love until it so desires” (Song of Songs 8:4). 

The bride seems to once again grow weak under the weight of her desire, leaning on her beloved for support as if returning from a long trek through the wilderness (Song of Songs 8:5). 

She then cries out to her beloved with one of the most famous sections of the song. 

She asks him to set his seal on her heart and arm, claiming her as his own (Song of Songs 8:6a). The intensity of her desire builds as she declares her love for the groom is as strong as death (Song of Songs 8:6b). The heat of her jealousy for her husband’s love is like the burning fire of jealousy God himself feels towards his people (Song of Songs 8:6c). All the water on earth cannot not quench it (Song of Songs 8:7). 

Finally, she says her love cannot be bought for any amount of money (Song of Songs 8:7b). Not even King Solomon in all his wealth could buy her away from her one true love (Song of Songs 8:12). 

As the song reaches a crescendo, we might expect it to end with the lover’s embrace. Instead, it ends with more unfulfilled desire. As he has been so many times in the song, the husband is far again, leaving the bride to cry out for him to return (Song of Songs 8:14).

Where is the Gospel?

The greatest love song about the greatest lover ends with a lack of fulfillment. The song is masterfully constructed to lead us to long for God, especially as he has been revealed in our heavenly husband—Jesus. 

He is the one for whom our souls actually long (Psalm 84:2). 

Yet, like the bride, the limits and limitations of our cultures, expected norms, and even the world itself, constantly frustrate our pursuits. That is why we must grab on to the fact that Jesus has and will overcome every barrier between his love and our experience of it (Romans 8:39). 

His love truly is stronger than death. This is not a romantic sentiment about Jesus, but real, solid truth. Driven by love for us, he died for us (John 3:16). And because of his love for us, accomplished by the power of his Father’s love for him, Jesus rose from the grave.

He burns with holy jealousy over us, wanting us to love him back (Deuteronomy 4:24). Nothing, not even suffering or death, can keep him from placing his seal of ownership upon all who believe in him (Ephesians 1:13). 

But we still wait for his return. Like Song of Songs, the whole Bible ends with a song of longing and unfulfilled desire (Revelation 22:17). Like the bride, may we wait for Jesus, full of love, expectancy, and praise. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who satisfies all our desires. And that you would see Jesus as the one who loves us unto death and is returning again, bringing eternal fulfillment."

As she did with the temple in the opening of the Song, the bride is now conflating her lover’s presence with the presence of God in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:8). 

The bride and groom flirt about the midday rendezvous they’re planning on the groom’s farmstead (Song of Songs 1:7). The lovers exchange compliments filled with language about fragrances, vineyards, flowers, and trees (Song of Songs 1:14). 

The bride recounts how her groom took her into the house of wine, where people were celebrating and drinking, and proclaimed his love for her before the crowd (Song of Songs 2:4).

She so desperately wants to be with her beloved that it hurts (Song of Songs 2:5). The groom tucks his arm behind her head, draws her close, and then the song is disrupted (Song of Songs 2:6). As soon as she gets close to her lover, their intimacy is interrupted. 

The bride turns to her bridesmaids and warns them not to awaken love until the proper time (Song of Songs 2:7). In the middle of her own heated passion, the bride warns them not to give themselves over to sexual intimacy until they are married. Because sex is a physical picture of intimacy with God, waiting until marriage is a picture of waiting for God. Sex outside of marriage is an attempt to manufacture intimacy apart from waiting on God.  

Apparently, the bride’s lover is not near anymore. He is far away, but calling out to her (Song of Songs 2:8). She calls to him to run quickly to her like a gazelle (Song of Songs 2:9). Even though the bride’s wait for a husband is over, she is still waiting. 

In response, the groom returns and speaks to her (Song of Songs 2:10). His language is again filled with mentions of food, animals, vineyards, and flowers (Song of Songs 2:13). The garden of love the bride longs for is springing up all around her with the presence of the groom (Song of Songs 2:12). 

The bride’s words finally break in after recounting her groom’s garden promises, “My beloved is mine and I am his” (Song of Songs 2:16). This statement of oneness and unity is a poetic reflection on God’s words to Adam and Eve in their garden, “They become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Longing and waiting are common ways the Bible speaks about our relationship with God (Psalm 130:5). That is because we have been separated from God since the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:23). 

All of us are created for intimacy with God. But upon separation from him at Eden, our deepest desires for contentment, satisfaction, and love are always unfulfilled. Whether we recognize it or not, we ache for God to return. We long for intimacy with the one for whom we were made. 

The good news is that Jesus is the groom who truly brings a new Garden of Eden when he returns (Revelation 21:1). Jesus’ return is also described using garden imagery (Revelation 22:2). When Jesus comes we will hear words that echo the bride’s words about belonging to her beloved—we will be with God and God will be with us (Revelation 21:3).  

But it is not yet the proper time for this love to awaken (Matthew 24:36). So, like the Daughters, we wait with longing (Romans 8:23). Nevertheless, we can say with the bride, “Look, here he comes” (Song of Songs 2:8). And our beloved will respond, “Yes, I am coming soon” (Revelation 22:20).

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God whose presence is better than the paradise of a perfect garden. And that you would see Jesus as the groom who is returning soon to bring us into that place."

In fact, he proved his love and desire for us by dying on the cross.",Website,Song Of Songs Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Here we have two of the longest songs from the husband praising the beauty of his wife. The songs surround a short conflict between the groom and other men who desire his bride. 

The husband lavishly compliments his wife’s beauty (Song of Songs 6:4). He uses vivid metaphors to speak of her flowing hair, perfect smile, and rosey cheeks (Song of Songs 6:7). Out of every other woman in the world, she alone is perfect to her husband (Song of Songs 6:9).  

When we last heard from the bride she was alone, searching for the groom who was waiting for her in their garden of love (Song of Songs 6:2). Now, the bride goes to join her husband in their garden (Song of Songs 6:11). 

Then, seemingly out of thin air, we hear the distant calls of other men, begging her to leave the garden and come home to her past life. The men beg her to return to them—even to dance for them (Song of Songs 6:13a).  

But the husband comes to her defense (Song of Songs 6:13b). He calls her attention back to their garden through another series of intimate praises (Song of Songs 7:1). But now, he not only compliments her beauty, but explains his desire for her (Song of Songs 7:8). 

The bride finally responds: “I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me” (Song of Songs 7:10). These words are a reverse of those spoken by God to Eve as a curse. In that Garden of Eden, God told Eve, “Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you” (Genesis 3:16). But now, the man desires the woman and they are equal (Song of Songs 6:3). 

This truth is highlighted when the woman is called a Shulammite, a feminine version of the name Solomon. Both names, Solomon and Shulam, come from the word Shalom, meaning peace or wholeness. When the two parts become whole, Shalom is found. 

Where is the Gospel? 

It can be difficult to hear God lavish compliments on us and rejoice over us with singing when there are so many other voices calling out for our attention (Zephaniah 3:17). Like the bride, we can easily and abruptly be snapped away from moments with God by the voices of culture, entertainment, or our past life.     

Those voices tell us to leave the imaginary garden of God’s love and throw ourselves back upon the previous ways we found validation and love. When God says we are beautiful, those voices drown him out with comparison. When God says he desires us, those voices tell us that type of love doesn’t exist.

But we need to listen to the truer voice of our husband, Jesus. As the woman (Shulam) was given the name of a king (Solomon), we have been given an even greater king-–Jesus (Matthew 12:42). 

He is the king of the whole earth and yet he calls us his bride (Revelation 19:7). When he calls us radiant, holy, blameless, without stain, wrinkle, or blemish, we can know that his voice is more true (Ephesians 5:27).

Jesus overturned the curse by desiring us (1 John 4:19). His desire for us is good news when we feel undesirable and God seems far away. But Jesus shows his great love by dying for us on the cross (Romans 5:8). We can escape the voices of the world and go back to the garden with God. There we finally find true peace and shalom because we have been made one with our husband Jesus (John 17:21). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who desires you. And that you would see Jesus as the one whose loving desire took him all the way to the cross."

Judah’s king, Jehoiachin was an evil man who deepened Judah’s rebellion against God. So God sent the king of Babylon to invade Judah’s borders and exile Judah’s citizens (Jeremiah 29:1-3). But Jeremiah writes a letter encouraging these captives that God will soon restore them to their land and restore their relationship with God. First, Jeremiah tells these Judean exiles to become good Babylonian citizens. They should plant gardens, improve their city, and advocate for peace and prosperity among their oppressors. They should get married and have children in anticipation of God returning them to their homes. Even though they are in the middle of a deserved punishment for the ways they have abandoned God and worshiped other gods, God has made plans for their good. There is hope even in exile because God has planned a new future for his disobedient and condemned people (Jeremiah 29:4-7). In just 70 years, God will fulfill all his promises, restore them to their homeland, and restore their broken relationship with him (Jeremiah 29:10-14). 

However, some religious leaders disagreed with Jeremiah’s understanding of their exile and his posture towards their oppressors. Some said the hope of God’s people wasn’t in settling down but in fighting for Judean independence alongside the current king of Judah (Jeremiah 29:15-16, 20). A priest in Jerusalem even sends a letter to one of the chief priests in Babylon asking why he has not punished Jeremiah for his seemingly unpatriotic and pro-Babylonian prophecies (Jeremiah 29:24-28). In response, Jeremiah says the future of God’s people belongs to those willing to accept their punishment in exile. God has already punished Judah once by sending one wave of exiles into Babylon. Jeremiah warns that if Judah’s religious and political leaders don’t stop resisting Babylonian rule, God will ensure both they and their nation will be destroyed (Jeremiah 29:15-22, 29-32). 

Where is the Gospel?

The only way God’s guilty and condemned people could return to their homeland, and their relationship with God was to accept God’s punishment, submit to exile, and seek the peace of their oppressors. None of Judah’s religious and political leaders wanted to hear this. They were too committed to their nation to imagine that God would ask them to give up what they valued most, much less restore it once it was lost. But God intends to restore his people to what they have lost when they accept guilt, choose exile, and seek the good of enemies. 

God is so committed to this that he did it himself in the person of Jesus. In Jesus, God accepted the guilt of his people and was exiled to the grave for the rebellion of his citizens. Even though his fellow citizens rejected him, God sought the good of his enemies and the peace of his oppressors by dying in their place (Romans 5:6-11). With some of his last words, Jesus asked God to forgive those responsible for his death (Luke 23:34). And just as God promised his people a restoration after their exile, God raised Jesus from the dead and returned him to his throne in heaven to rule alongside him.

Like Judah was literally, many of us feel like exiles spiritually. We feel guilty, condemned, and far from his promises of restoration. But the good news is that by faith in Jesus, you can be close to God and experience his restorative power. When you accept your guilt and embrace Jesus’ death in your place, God promises he will give you a new home and relationship with him forever.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who restores his people. And may you see Jesus as the one who has accepted the guilt and exile of people like us. "

Before Jeremiah was born, God chose him to be his representative and spokesman to the disobedient people of Judah (Jeremiah 1:4-5). And Jeremiah has just traveled through the city of Jerusalem, preaching and prophesying its imminent destruction for its disloyalty to God and the continued practice of child sacrifice. In response to his public denouncement of Judah and her leadership, one of the temple’s leading priests, Pashhur, arrests Jeremiah, has him beaten, and places him in the stocks overnight (Jeremiah 20:1-2). The following day, Jeremiah reveals that God has given Pashhur a new name: “Terror on Every Side.” His new name is his future. Pashhur has failed to listen to the God he claims to serve. He has used his platform to speak lies in God’s name and discredit Jeremiah, the prophet God has chosen as his representative. So, for his role in Jeremiah’s suffering, Pashhur will soon die (Jeremiah 20:3-6).

But disturbed by his night in the stocks, Jeremiah accuses God of lying to him (Jeremiah 20:7). When God commissioned him as his prophet, made him his representative, and placed his words in his mouth, God said he would protect Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:18). But as he’s faithfully delivered God’s message he’s only experienced public shaming, ridicule, and torture (Jeremiah 20:8). Every time he opens his mouth his peers relentlessly persecute him. And if he tries to say nothing, God’s words start to eat him alive, and it feels as if his bones are on fire (Jeremiah 20:9-10). But despite all this, Jeremiah still believes that God is a strong warrior who fights on behalf of the innocent and the righteous (Jeremiah 20:11-12). So he resolves to worship the God who rescues weak and needy people like him (Jeremiah 10:13).

But right after Jeremiah rallied himself to worship, Jeremiah wishes he had never been born. In light of the suffering God’s calling has forced on his life, he says that if God chose him before he was born, his birthday is nothing to celebrate (Jeremiah 20:14). He wishes God would kill the man who neglected to kill him in his mother’s womb. Jeremiah believes his stillbirth would have been better than the life of shame, sorrow, and bitterness that has come from being God’s chosen prophet (Jeremiah 20:15-18). 

Where is the Gospel?

The brutal honesty of Jeremiah can be difficult to hear. But Jeremiah’s tortured screams and panicked prayers ask God the questions all of us ask, even if we don’t dare to say them out loud. If God is good, why do we suffer? If God has promised to protect us, why doesn’t he? Why does God say one thing but do another? Is God a liar? Are we just deceived? 

The answers to these questions are revealed in God’s final prophet, Jesus. Jesus was not only God’s commissioned representative on earth but God’s son (Hebrews 1:1-3). Like Jeremiah, he was hunted, slandered, mocked, beaten, and even sentenced to death by the temple’s leading priests. Jesus knows Jeremiah’s agony and has even prayed our blunt prayers. As Jeremiah questioned God in his wooden stocks, Jesus asked God on the cross why he had abandoned him, his only son (Matthew 27:46). Jesus knows the pain of our seemingly unanswered prayers.

But God’s answer to Jesus’s prayer came three days later. God raised Jesus from the dead (Romans 8:11). As God’s representative, he embodies God’s answer to our blunt questions, dark thoughts, and hard prayers. And God’s answer is resurrection. Everyone who brings their questions and sufferings to God will be answered with life from the dead. God is not a liar. We are not deceived. He has heard our prayers. Our enemies, even death itself, will be defeated. God has entered our suffering, and he promises we will be raised with him (Romans 6:5)

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who hears our prayers. And may you see Jesus as the one whose death and resurrection is our answer.  "

Thankfully, God has given us that King in his son, Jesus. ",Website,Jeremiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The fate of Judah hinges on its kings’ willingness to listen to God’s words. If a king listens, he and his nation will flourish. But if he doesn’t, he and his government are doomed. When Jeremiah first became a prophet, Judah’s king, Josiah, found a copy of God’s Word in the temple. When a man named Shaphan reads it to him, he becomes afraid and tears his robe. Josiah was scared because he realized how far Judah had strayed from God’s laws and the severe punishment due to lawbreakers like them. So Josiah recommitted himself to God’s Word, burned the shrines and idols around Judah, and asked a prophet what to do next. Josiah’s prophet tells him that because he repented, he would not experience the punishment God’s Word demanded and would live the rest of his days in peace (2 Kings 22-23). Josiah saved his people from disaster during his reign by listening to and obeying God’s Word.

Josiah’s son, Jehoiakim, is now in power, and Jeremiah warns him that if he does not stop Judah’s evil and idolatry, God will punish him. Babylon will invade their country and burn their capital to the ground—but Josiah’s son does not listen. So God tells Jeremiah to compile all the prophecies he’s delivered over the last 20 years and make a final plea to his people in hopes of their repentance (Jeremiah 36:1-10). Jeremiah’s prophecies are then read to three different audiences, each more powerful than the last until finally they are read to King Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 36:11-19). 

But as they are read, King Jehoiakim proves he’s nothing like his father. Unlike his father, he doesn’t fear God, tear his robe, burn down idols, or ask God’s prophets for advice. Instead, he resents God’s warnings and tears Jeremiah’s prophecies line by line from their scroll and burns them in a fire (Jeremiah 36:20-23). And rather than asking for the prophet’s advice, he demands Jeremiah’s arrest (Jeremiah 36:24-26). But when word reaches Jeremiah that Jehoiakim burned his scroll of prophecies, God tells him to rewrite the ending. The story has changed. It’s too late for repentance. Jehoiakim has sealed Judah’s fate. Disaster is coming for Jehoiakim’s kingdom; Babylon will exile him, and his dynasty will end with him (Jeremiah 36:27-31). And so, King Jehoiakim’s unwillingness to listen to God’s Word dooms his people. 

Where is the Gospel?

The response of Judah’s kings to God’s Word determines the course of their nation. And where Josiah saved his people, Jehoiakim doomed them. Jeremiah teaches us that we need a king who responds appropriately to God’s Word. Thankfully, God has given us that King in his son, Jesus. In fact, Jesus’ name is an English form of the name “Josiah.” And the same royal blood that ran through Josiah’s veins ran through his. But even better than his namesake and forefather, Jesus not only listened and obeyed God’s commands, he embodied them (John 5:16, John 1:14). In his life, the flourishing God promised to Josiah became a reality. When Jesus touched people, they were healed. When Jesus spoke, forces of darkness and evil scattered (Luke 4:38-41). When he cried by the tomb of his friend, his friend came back to life (John 11:43). 

But even though Jesus embodied God’s Word perfectly, he was torn apart like Jehoiakim tore and burned Jeremiah’s scroll. Yet, even in his death, Jesus made real and embodied God’s Word. He was condemned, doomed, and exiled, just as Jeremiah’s prophecies warned Jehoiakim would be. In Jesus’ death, God’s King embodied God’s words of judgment against everyone who refused to listen to him. Jesus took into his own body the death, exile, and doom people like Jehoiakim deserve. 

But because Jesus embodied both the life God commands and the judgment God requires, Jesus rewrites the story. He is the King who perfectly obeyed and the King who has died for his people’s disobedience. So God raised Jesus from the dead and invites all of us to accept the eternal rule of King Jesus. In his Kingdom, there is both pardon for our disobedience and a life of flourishing forever.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has given his word to kings. And may you see Jesus as the one who determines the course of his Kingdom and the lives of all who repent. "

The previous 44 chapters of Jeremiah’s prophecies have all pronounced a day of judgment against Judah. After Jeremiah’s secretary finishes compiling all of Jeremiah’s warnings, he is afraid and overwhelmed with grief over the coming loss of his nation. But Jeremiah widens Baruch’s view of what God is doing in their lifetime. He tells him that God is judging Judah for her rebellion, but he will also judge Judah’s enemies. God's judgment of his people is just the beginning. God is coming to do justice against all evil and all pride in all the earth (Jeremiah 45:1-5). 

In the next chapters, Jeremiah condemns the neighboring nations of Egypt, Philistia, Moab, Ammon, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Hazor, and Elam. Jeremiah predicts they will fall to Babylon, just as Judah has. While God had condemned Judah for her failure to listen to God and his laws, God condemned these nations for their pride and their cruelty towards God’s people. Egypt boasts their dominion is as sure as the Nile River is wet (Jeremiah 46:8). Moab’s arrogance is known throughout the world (Jeremiah 48:29). Ammon believes their wealth makes them immune from attack (Jeremiah 49:4). Edom believes their superior military positioning justified their war crimes (Jeremiah 49:16). But God promises whatever wrongs they have done in their pride will be repaid in their humiliation. Babylon is coming for them all.

But Jeremiah also prophecies that every nation God humbles for their pride and violence will one day be restored to their former glory. God first tells his people in Judah that he plans to protect and restore all they have lost (Jeremiah 46:27-28). Then God promises Egypt, the nation that once enslaved God’s people, that he will rebuild their civilization (Jeremiah 46:26). Moab, Ammon, and Elam (nations who at one time or another attacked God’s people) are also all promised a future restoration (Jeremiah 48:47; 49:6, 34-39). God is upending the world as Baruch and Jeremiah know it. Babylon’s apocalypse will judge the pride of all nations, not just Judah’s. But after their pride has been dealt with, God promises the ancestral lands of all people will be restored. 

Where is the Gospel?

If you’ve found it difficult to read 44 chapters of prophecy after prophecy of God’s coming judgment against his people in Judah, you are just like Baruch. And God’s word to Baruch is the same word he offers you. God wants to widen your view of what he is doing. God is coming to entirely rid his world of pride, evil, and violence. But God is also coming to replant the humble in their homelands and restore what was stolen by others' pride. 

In the very last book of the Bible, the prophet John tells us the same thing—namely, that God will come very soon to judge all pride once and for all. One day, every proud nation of the world will gather against God, ready to oppose him and those who humbly trust him (Revelation 19:19). But in the exact moment they muster their armies, God sends his son Jesus, the true King of the world, out to meet them. And when he arrives, Jesus simply speaks, the proud are defeated and scattered, and God’s people inherit the whole earth as their eternal homeland (Revelation 19:20-21). And just as judgment wasn’t the end of the story for Judah or the nations that attacked her, it is not the end of the story for our world either. God creates a new earth where the humble from all countries who have rallied behind Jesus inherit homelands and have all they’ve lost restored (Revelation 21:1-3). Baruch was supposed to be encouraged by Jeremiah’s partial picture of the justice and restoration God would bring at the hands of Babylon. This means we can be even more encouraged by the full story of God’s restoration that will be brought about through Jesus. 

See For Yourself

So, I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who will judge the enemies of pride and evil fully and finally. And may you see Jesus as the one God sends to humiliate the proud and restore the humble. "

Judah is about to vanish as a nation. Their only hope is to listen to what Jeremiah has consistently prophesied by submitting to Babylon and its king. Sadly, even after Judah’s capital is destroyed and most of its citizens are exiled, Judah does not do this. After their victory, Babylon deputizes Gedaliah as a puppet governor. It warns him that Judah lost their nation because they failed to obey their God by submitting to them (Jeremiah 40:1-6). As word spreads that the Babylonian onslaught has ended, poor farmers, refugees, and Judah’s few remaining militias gather around him. At first, Gedaliah repeats the Babylonian captain and Jeremiah’s prophecies and tells this remnant that their only hope is to accept God’s punishment and serve Babylon well (Jeremiah 40:7-12). He hopes this tiny but faithful remnant might begin to rebuild God’s kingdom once again.

But quickly, Gedaliah is assassinated, and a new rebel leader, Johanan, rises, calls Judah to join forces with Egypt, make one last stand against Babylon, and regain their kingdom with the help of Egypt’s gods and military power (Jeremiah 40:13-41:18). At first, Johanan asks Jeremiah to seek God’s counsel and promises to do whatever God says (Jeremiah 42:1-6). After ten days of praying, Jeremiah tells Johanan not to fear Babylon and to stay in Judah (Jeremiah 42:7-12). Jeremiah warns that God will view going to Egypt for protection as an act of rebellion on par with the disobedience that incurred Judah’s exile in the first place (Jeremiah 42:13-22). Johanan must trust God and stay in Judah rather than trust the power and gods of Egypt. But Johanan accuses Jeremiah of conspiring against him, orders Judah’s remnant to march towards Egypt in defiance of God’s words, and drags Jeremiah with them (Jeremiah 43:1-7).

Once they arrive, Jeremiah pronounces they cannot hide from God’s judgment. Babylon will find them and destroy all who have trusted Egypt and her gods over God and his power (Jeremiah 43:8-13). Jeremiah spends a whole chapter indicting Judah for their faithlessness in Egypt and promises that soon Babylon will conquer the leaders and gods they’ve chosen to trust over him (Jeremiah 44). Judah’s story then abruptly ends. Babylon invades Egypt, God’s people scatter, and Judah essentially vanishes. The only people of God left are imprisoned in Babylon. 

Where is the Gospel?

Jeremiah’s account of Judah’s history ends with their total judgment. There is no one left whom God has not punished for their faithlessness. Judah’s disintegration proves that to the bottom, God’s people are unwilling to submit to him and his commands. Their only hope for rescue is if God raises them out of exile by his power. 

And one day, God does—he enters into his people’s exile himself. God, in the person of Jesus, was born under Roman rule to a people who still resisted God’s commands (John 3:16; Luke 4:18-19). But Jesus, unlike his fellow countrymen, submitted to God no matter the price (John 5:19-20). Unlike Johanan and so many other Judean citizens and kings, when God tells Jesus to submit to Roman power, he does so, even when that means his death (Luke 22:42). Then, just as Jeremiah prophesied, after submitting to imperial power and accepting exile among the dead, Jesus rose from his grave (Luke 24:1-12). In that moment, a Kingdom that Gedaliah could only dream of was born. Jesus secured through his exile and resurrection a Kingdom of eternal life, where no empire, king, or even death holds power (1 Corinthians 15:55-57). Jesus has done what no Judean leader ever did, and in so doing, he has rebuilt God’s Kingdom and rules as the true King of God’s people, promising we will never be exiled from him again. 

God’s last word to us is not his powerful anger but his overwhelming love demonstrated in the person of Jesus. God never leaves his people in their judgment, hopelessness, and exile. God always provides a powerful way to rescue his own. So instead of trusting kings, powers, or other gods, trust Jesus, who will raise you with him.

Babylon is a growing threat to the kingdom of Judah, and the prophet Jeremiah tells his people that their only hope is to surrender. But this strikes the religious leaders of Judah as unpatriotic at best and a denial of their faith at worst—after all, God gave them this land. But as Judah’s royal house and religious elite prepare to fight for their God-given nation, Jeremiah begins a public campaign against them. No matter how big an army Judah can muster, their country will be destroyed if God’s people do not start trusting God for their nation’s survival and obey his laws once again (Jeremiah 26:1-6). The religious elite are angry at Jeremiah's accusations, so they drag him to a local courthouse, accuse Jeremiah of being a traitor to both the king and God’s people, and demand his immediate execution (Jeremiah 26:7-11). Defending himself, Jeremiah says they have no right to condemn him simply for speaking what God has told him to say. Besides, Judah’s destruction isn’t inevitable. If they trust God to protect their nation and abandon the treaties and idols they currently worship, God will preserve their city (Jeremiah 26:12-13). In response to Jeremiah’s defense, the courtroom is divided, and Judah’s king lets Jeremiah go (Jeremiah 26:16-24).

But Judah’s leaders did not listen to Jeremiah’s warnings over the next decade. Jeremiah’s prophecies of doom start to come true. Zedekiah, Judah's last king, barely holds onto power and contemplates rebellion against his oppressor. But Jeremiah places an animal’s yoke on his back, walks into Zedekiah’s throne room, and tells him to submit and surrender to God’s servant—the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 27:1-7). If he refuses to accept the yoke of Babylonian rule, he will be punished like a mule who disobeys his master (Jeremiah 27:8-9). However, if God’s people are willing to trust God and surrender to Babylon temporarily, God promises that he will soon restore them to their land (Jeremiah 27:10-11). 

But again, this message flies in the face of Judah’s religious presumption and political pride. The prophet Hananiah snatches the yoke from Jeremiah’s neck and breaks it on the ground, declaring that Babylon’s yoke will be broken in two years (Jeremiah 28:1-11). But Jeremiah says history will prove who is telling the truth. Hananiah is a liar. If Judah fails to submit, Babylon’s yoke will only get heavier, and what little they have left will be taken from them (Jeremiah 27:17-21; Jeremiah 28:12-17). The only hope for Judah is to surrender, be exiled, and trust that God will one day return his people to their land and restore what they have lost (Jeremiah 27:22). 

Where is the Gospel?

The actions of Judah’s leadership reveal they abandoned their trust in God long ago. Judah must go into exile; God’s people must embody nationally the spiritual exile of their hearts. But God says that it’s in exile that he will begin to restore his people. And through their nation’s death, he will repair their broken trust.

But this would not come true until centuries later when another prophet named Jesus would deliver a very similar message that sounded like blasphemy to the religious elite. Jesus told his followers that they would need to trust him and submit, not to the yoke of imperial power, but to the gentle yoke he came to bring (Matthew 11:29-30). The gentle yoke of Jesus would not be a political exile but the yoke of death. Just as offensive to us as submitting to Babylon would have been in Jeremiah’s day, Jesus says we must lose our lives if we are to find them. And we must take on our back a heavy cross if we want to live (Matthew 16:24-26). Like Jeremiah, Jesus told us we have to submit to death and exile if we are going to experience God’s restoration. But the death and exile Jesus told us to shoulder is not our own; it’s his.

Jesus took up the cross he told his followers to carry. He lost his life so that we could find ours when he submitted to the yoke of Roman execution. But as both he and Jeremiah promised, submitting to death and exile brought life. Jesus rose from the dead (Mark 16:9). In his resurrection, the restoration Jeremiah promised Judah came true. Everyone who shares Jesus’ gentle yoke of death is promised to join him in his resurrection life forever (Romans 6:3-4).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who calls us to submit to his yoke. And may you see Jesus as the one who restores his people even after death. "

",Website,Jeremiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

For 40 years, Jeremiah has prophesied that God would one day send Babylon to invade Judah and exile its citizens for their failure to listen and obey God. But Jeremiah’s last prophecy is delivered to the king of Babylon just before Babylon besieges Judah. In it, Jeremiah announces Babylon’s destruction for abusing its role in Judah’s exile (Jeremiah 51:59-64). Jeremiah’s last prophecy isn’t of Judah’s deserved punishment but the defeat of Judah’s enemy and Judah’s ultimate restoration.

Jeremiah predicts Babylon’s ruin and how God will avenge the violence Babylon gleefully inflicted against Judah (Jeremiah 50:1-13). And for their arrogance, their whole civilization will lay ruined and humiliated (Jeremiah 50:31-32). Even though they have been a predator for decades, hunting and conquering the weak, God will raise an even greater nation to turn Babylon into prey (Jeremiah 51:34-35). And every idol Babylon has prayed to and trusted will be exposed as the dead lumps of metal they are (Jeremiah 51:17-19). For all the wrongs Babylon has and will inflict upon God’s people, Jeremiah promises that God will hold them accountable, destroy the guilty, and free his people (Jeremiah 51:24). Babylon will soon be judged for their great evil. Soon, the people of God will return to their homeland.

The final chapter of Jeremiah is not a prophecy at all. Instead, it describes in gruesome detail the fall of Judah at Babylon’s hands and how all the warnings Jeremiah spent 40 years delivering came true. Judah’s king is captured, and his sons are murdered. Judah’s citizens are first starved and then exiled. Both Judah’s capital and God’s temple are burned to the ground (Jeremiah 52:1-17). Every precious metal and sacred object is weighed, recorded, and added to Babylon’s treasury (Jeremiah 52:18-23). Finally, those not exiled are either left as beggars or executed (Jeremiah 52:24-30). 

The last chapter of Jeremiah recounts Judah’s fall in extreme detail because it means there is hope. If Jeremiah was right about Judah’s fall, then he must be right about Babylon's too. If Judah has been judged, Babylon will fall just as God said. As a sign that God will do this, Jeremiah tells us that a prince from Judah’s exiled royal family now sits at the Babylonian king's dinner table (Jeremiah 52:31-34). God’s royal family is still alive, Judah is not dead, and a new king has risen in exile. Jeremiah ends with the hope that if God’s prophecies of doom have all come true, his promises of Judah’s restoration and the defeat of her enemies will also come true. 

Where is the Gospel?

Jeremiah’s prophecies didn’t simply come true in his time; they also set the pattern for God’s victory over evil and pride in all times. The future hope that Babylon would fall was grounded in the fact that Judah’s prophesied destruction and judgment came true. Similarly, our future hope that our enemies will be defeated is grounded in the fact that Jesus died and was judged on the cross (John 9:39). If Jesus has been judged just as God said. We can be confident that God will defeat all our enemies and restore his Kingdom. 

Revelation, the very last book of the Bible, describes some of the events leading up to God’s ultimate judgment. It follows the same pattern as the book of Jeremiah. One of the first images in the book is of a bloodied lamb sitting on a throne. It symbolizes that just as Judah was judged and exiled for its evil, Jesus takes his throne, bloodied from his crucifixion. And just as God raises a royal son to the king’s table in exile, Jesus is raised from his exile among the dead and seated on a throne in heaven (Revelation 4). Then, the government responsible for violently killing King Jesus and his people falls in a climactic battle (Revelation 19). The author of Revelation even calls this world power “Babylon.” And just as God’s people returned to their kingdom in Jeremiah’s day, in Revelation, God returns to earth, establishes an eternal Kingdom, and promises to live with his people forever (Revelation 21). The future that Jeremiah predicts and comes true in Judah’s history sets the pattern for how God will forever deal with all evil, pride, violence, and disobedience. 

So, like the original readers of Jeremiah, we wait. We wait for the day that all our enemies are dealt with and all evil and pride will be purged from the earth. And as we wait, we can look up and see Jesus, risen from the dead, seated on God’s throne as both a prophecy and a sign that one day we will rise in victory just like him (Colossians 3:1-3).

God tells his prophet Jeremiah to stand in the middle of the temple in Jerusalem and preach a sermon calling out the hypocrisy of Jerusalem's religious establishment (Jeremiah 7:1-2). They are guilty of representing God while oppressing foreigners, exploiting the vulnerable, and murdering their children on the altars of foreign gods (Jeremiah 7:5-9, 30-31). What’s worse, they believe the continued operation of the temple is proof that God approves of their leadership (Jeremiah 7:4,10). But Jeremiah says they have turned God’s house into a religious front for exploitation. It’s nothing but a “den of thieves,” and God is coming to burn their capital and temple down (Jeremiah 7:11-20). Ever since the day God brought his people out of Egypt, they have stubbornly rejected him. God has finally had enough (Jeremiah 17:17-26). Jeremiah announces that God has abandoned this evil generation of leaders and will soon avenge the blood of the children they have murdered by burning their temple down (Jeremiah 7:27-29; 7:33-8:3). 

God then tells Jeremiah to weep over the state of his nation publicly. Jeremiah laments how Judah has turned her back on the God who rescued them in the past (Jeremiah 8:4-7). He mourns over Judah as they brazenly teach that there are no divine consequences for their disobedience and disloyalty to God (Jeremiah 8:8-12). In tears, Jeremiah announces there is no rescue from the terror God will send their way (Jeremiah 8:13-17). 

But as Jeremiah says these things, he can’t stomach them. His heart drops in anguish at the thought of his people being destroyed (Jeremiah 8:18). He begs God to listen to his prayers and stop the coming calamity (Jeremiah 8:19-20). But as Jeremiah keeps speaking, he realizes he cannot heal a wound that God inflicts. And he comes to understand there is no cure but judgment for Judah’s restless and relentless evil (Jeremiah 8:21-9:11). Since God’s people have totally rejected him and blindly followed their hearts at the cost of their children, Jeremiah knows Judah and its temple must be destroyed (Jeremiah 9:12-16). 

Jeremiah says the only thing Judah can do now is to weep and wail (Jeremiah 9:17-22). Judah has been given a choice between dead idols and God’s eternal love, justice, and righteousness—and they’ve chosen death (Jeremiah 9:23-26). Judah has hard-heartedly chosen created, immobile, and powerless things over the living, speaking, and creating God (Jeremiah 10:1-16). And for this foolishness, God must judge Judah (Jeremiah 10:17-18). Jeremiah ends his sermon proclaiming that the moral rot in Judah is incurable and only asks that God would be merciful and not wipe them out completely (Jeremiah 10:19-25). 

Where is the Gospel?

Neither Jerusalem nor its temple leaders could do anything to change the people’s restless and relentlessly evil hearts. It was through their leadership that Judah imported the idols and gods of other nations and further doomed their people. Jeremiah knew that for the problem of Judah’s hard hearts to be cured, the institutions responsible needed to be brought down and new ones established in their place. And it's through Jesus, God’s ultimate prophet, that sick temples are torn down, and the hard hearts of God’s people are softened. 

Like Jeremiah, Jesus stood in Jerusalem’s temple, decried its hypocrisy, and announced its coming destruction. Quoting Jeremiah, Jesus calls the religious institution of his day a “den of thieves” for its brand of injustice (Matthew 21:13). And like Jeremiah, he weeps over the inevitable destruction soon to befall his people at the hands of a foreign army (Luke 19:41-44). However, Jesus does more than simply call out the temple’s hypocrisy and announce its destruction. Jesus came to solve the problem of his people’s hard hearts. This is why Jesus announces the fall of Jerusalem’s temple and says it will be rebuilt in his own body after spending three days in the grave (John 2:19-21).

When Jesus died, the temple of his body provided a way for the evil in all our hearts to be totally judged without harming us. And when he rose from the dead, he created a new temple made with people, not bricks. And he fills our hearts, not with idols made of stone or metal, but with his eternal love, justice, and righteousness (John 16:13). Whenever we trust in Jesus, the sick temples we have built for ourselves are torn down, and he heals our hearts.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who judges his people’s evil. And may you see Jesus as the one who died in place of his people so he could heal our hearts."

God tells Jeremiah to visit various places around Jerusalem and prophesy Judah’s imminent destruction for the ways they have abandoned the God who created them. First, Jeremiah visits the gates of Jerusalem, warns its citizens to follow God’s laws concerning the Sabbath, and calls them to rest on the appropriate day (Jeremiah 17:19-22). Even God rested after he created the world. And Jeremiah reminds Jerusalem that God disciplined their forefathers for not following their Maker’s design and will do so again if this generation persists in their restlessness (Jeremiah 17:27). But Jeremiah also says that if the people of Judah will recommit themselves to God’s laws by resting once a week, God will make Jerusalem into a thriving city that will never be destroyed (Jeremiah 17:23-27). 

Jeremiah then visits a pottery shop and receives a prophetic message while observing the ceramicist at work. As the potter turns the clay on his wheel, the vase he’s making needs to be reformed. The potter destroys the vase and reworks the clay into a new one (Jeremiah 18:1-4). God tells Jeremiah that Judah is like clay and that he is like a potter. Just as the potter can destroy, reform, remake, and start again with his creation, so he can with his people (Jeremiah 18:5-9). If, at any point, his people break from his intentions for them, he will simply start again. So, God begs his people to reform their ways and avoid disaster. But once again, Judah refuses to obey the designs of their Maker (Jeremiah 18:11-12). 

In a public forum, Jeremiah laments Judah’s rebellion against their Maker and the religious establishment’s role in encouraging it. After all, nothing in nature disobeys its Maker. Snow on the mountains doesn’t melt when it’s cold. Rivers don’t spontaneously stop flowing (Jeremiah 18:13-14). But the people God has made and loved have rejected both him and his intentions for them. So Jeremiah tells Judah they can expect swift decreation for their rebellion against their Maker (Jeremiah 18:15-17). When the religious establishment hears this critique of their leadership, they retaliate and attempt to discredit and murder Jeremiah (Jeremiah 18:18). So Jeremiah prays that God would protect him and bring to justice those conspiring against him (Jeremiah 18:19-23). 

God then tells Jeremiah to buy a bottle of wine and escort the religious leaders of Jerusalem to the shrine of child sacrifice just outside the city in the valley of Hinnom (Jeremiah 19:1-6; 7:31). Once they arrive, Jeremiah denounces the idolatry the priests have allowed to thrive, and the children they’ve allowed to die under their leadership. Perhaps while pouring out the wine, Jeremiah announces an army will descend on the valley they’re standing in and fill it with the blood of Judah’s guilty leadership (Jeremiah 19:7-9). Jeremiah then smashes the bottle on the ground. He says that just as his bottle has shattered beyond repair, Judah will never recover from the disaster God will bring in response to his people’s depravity and idolatry (Jeremiah 19:10-15).  

Where is the Gospel?

Judah is in rebellion against their Creator and Maker. But the purpose of Jeremiah’s prophecies isn’t simply to announce the inevitable destruction of rebels and walk away. Jeremiah’s prophecies are given in hopes that Judah and her leadership would repent of their evil and receive God’s mercy. Jeremiah prophesies a potential future restoration of God’s people despite their rebellion (Jeremiah 17:23-27). And God directs Jeremiah to a potter who doesn’t throw out his lump of clay but reworks it (Jeremiah 18:5-9). God doesn’t want to destroy his creations when they fail, but like a patient potter, he desires to reform, reshape, and rework his people into something far more glorious (2 Peter 3:9).

Ultimately, this reworking, reforming, and reshaping was not accomplished through Jeremiah’s life and prophecies but when God became clay. God took on the form of humans who rebelled against their Maker but lived obediently to God’s creative design. In the body of Jesus, God showed us that God takes the form of rebellious humans and shapes it into a new creation aligned with their Creator’s designs (2 Corinthians 5:17). And like all humans, Jesus died. But even Jesus’ death prophesied the glorious future God is forming for his creatures. Jesus rose from the dead, proving that the end of God’s people is not death and decreation but eternal resurrection life destined to live in God’s creative power.

Hundreds of years before the prophet Jeremiah lived, God made twelve tribes of ex-slaves his people. In a sense, he “married” them. Like in marriage ceremonies, God’s people agreed to become God’s bride and to be faithful to him alone. That faithfulness was encoded in a series of vows, called a covenant, where Israel promised to love God with all her heart and have no other gods but him (Exodus 24:1-7). But by Jeremiah’s time, God’s people had proven themselves to be chronic adulterers. God’s unfaithful people looked for ways to worship gods other than the one who rescued them from their slavery. In a series of heartbreaking poems, God weeps over his broken relationship with his people and begs them to restore their marriage.

In the first poems, Jeremiah remembers how Israel was once devoted to God like a newlywed spouse and how God protected her like a young lover (Jeremiah 2:1-3). But that love quickly soured. God’s people forgot their vows and tried to secure new protection through political alliances and pledging allegiance to foreign leaders and their gods (Jeremiah 2:4-8). As if initiating divorce proceedings, God brings formal charges against his beloved and says Israel has abandoned her marriage for a string of illicit affairs (Jeremiah 2:9-13). Israel is like a brazen prostitute. And God claims there is no “I’m sorry” that can wipe the stain of her infidelities from his mind (Jeremiah 2:20-24; 3:2). For her part, Israel doesn’t deny her adultery and idolatry. Instead, she claims she is innocent and her polyamory is no reason to initiate divorce (Jeremiah 2:23, 29, 35). But quoting their marriage vows in the book of Deuteronomy, God reminds his bride that they agreed that once a spouse has been unfaithful to their partner, the other can never take them back (Jeremiah 3:1; Deuteronomy 24:1-4). Their marriage has effectively dissolved.

But God still longs for a future where their relationship is restored. Despite the infidelities of Israel’s tribes, God still profoundly desires for all his people to repent and return to him (Jeremiah 3:6-14). God promises that if she does, he will give Israel new leaders. These leaders will restore the loyalty between bride and groom and guide God’s people into a new era of faithfulness to God, their husband (Jeremiah 3:22). If they return, God says he will return to his once-adulterous bride and restore their marriage forever (Jeremiah 3:15-16; 4:1-4).

Where is the Gospel?

God's love for his people did not end the day their marriage dissolved. One day, God’s people will again experience God’s covenant love. Abandonment and divorce would not be God’s last words to his unfaithful people. 

It’s easy to read Jeremiah and become anxious, wondering if God might abandon or punish us for our choices, just as he divorced Israel. But God so loved his unfaithful people that he came to earth in the person of Jesus and announced that God the Groom had finally arrived, ready to marry his people (Mark 2:19). Jesus' first miracle was to save a wedding in jeopardy (John 2:1-11). When Jesus spoke about his upcoming death by a bloody crucifixion, he quoted Jeremiah. He said that his blood would create a new covenant—a new marriage between his unfaithful bride and himself (Luke 22:20). And the very last chapter of the Bible announces that the end of history is a wedding day between God and his perfected people (Revelation 22). God’s divorce of Israel is not his last word to his unfaithful people—Jesus’ life, death, resurrection, and return are. You do not need to be afraid of God abandoning you or divorcing you from his presence forever. Jesus died for his bride’s unfaithfulness and was temporarily divorced from God’s love so that we would never have to be. All those who trust Jesus’ love and turn to him will be with God forever. So trust God’s husbandly love demonstrated and offered in Jesus and return to a relationship with him.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who loves his people despite their unfaithfulness. And may you see Jesus as the one who has died and risen to begin a new covenant of eternal love for you and me. "

God tells Jeremiah to travel through Judah and remind its citizens of the covenant God made with their people on Mt. Sinai. A covenant was an ancient treaty made between two kingdoms. After delivering them from slavery in Egypt, God made two promises in that first covenant. First, he promised that if his people obeyed the terms of their covenant, he would give them a kingdom (Deuteronomy 11:9). Second, he promised that if Judah strayed from his covenant, he would judge the evil among his people. Jeremiah reminds Jerusalem that God delivered on his first promise—they are living in the land God gave their ancestors (Jeremiah 11:1-5). But despite God being faithful to his end of the covenant, their ancestors were faithless in theirs. They rejected the God who established their nation by worshiping idols, so God upheld his second promise and enforced the covenant consequences (Jeremiah 11:6-8). God’s people should not repeat the mistakes of the past. They should recommit themselves to the covenant God made with them or lose the land God has given them.

But God knows that Judah has no intention of recommitting themselves to his covenant. He tells Jeremiah that Judah is scheming ways to break their covenant without consequences (Jeremiah 11:9-10). Even though evil and idolatry are growing, they hope that by making sacrifices in God’s temple, they can trick God into preserving the covenant despite their disobedience (Jeremiah 11:12-15). God tells Jeremiah to tell his people that he sees through all this. Judah will not escape. Judah will fall, and her people will be exiled for their covenant unfaithfulness (Jeremiah 11:16). 

As Jeremiah delivers these words, religious and political leaders from Jeremiah’s hometown plot his assassination (Jeremiah 11:18-20). Desperate, Jeremiah immediately asks God to keep his second covenant promise and save his life by removing the violent men currently ruling Judah (Jeremiah 11:21-12:1-4). But God says that while he sees the evil in Judah, judgment won’t come as quickly as Jeremiah would like (Jeremiah 12:5-9). Jeremiah must wait until God gathers a coalition of foreign armies who will eventually rescue Jeremiah and judge Judah’s evil (Jeremiah 12:10-13). 

Surprisingly, God also promises Jeremiah that after he upholds his second promise of judgment, he will fulfill his first covenant promise of a new Kingdom. Every nation that attacks Judah will themselves be judged for the evil they commit. And once the whole world has been judged, God will invite all countries of the world to join the new Global Kingdom of justice and peace under God’s protection (Jeremiah 12:14-17).

Where is the Gospel?

When evil men began plotting Jeremiah’s murder, he asked God to come quickly and perform swift justice against his corrupt nation. But God told Jeremiah to wait for that justice. God was planning both the judgment of Judah’s evil and the world’s evil. Through those acts of judgment, God would eventually include humanity in God’s Global Kingdom of Justice and Peace under a New Covenant. God was telling Jeremiah to wait for the day Judah’s final King—Jesus—died. 

Just as God judged Judah’s evil by sending armies to remove its leaders from power, God fulfilled his second covenant promise and judged the corruption, idolatry, and faithlessness of his people in Jesus. Like a good King, he took responsibility for his people’s covenant faithlessness. In Jesus, God’s New Kingdom and New Covenant can finally begin (Luke 22:20). The New Covenant promised that anyone from any nation of the world who accepts the rule of King Jesus would be rescued from the consequences of their covenant breaking and be with God in his New Kingdom of justice and peace forever. We know all this has come to pass because King Jesus rose from the dead and now sits on the throne of his heavenly Kingdom, ready to enforce his New Covenant and ensure the whole world is invited to join his new Kingdom.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who keeps his covenant. And may you see Jesus as the one who brings to justice the world’s evil and makes a new covenant and Kingdom with us."

Judah has chosen loyalty to foreign gods and kings over trusting their God to protect and provide for their nation. So God tells Jeremiah to announce that an army will invade Judah’s borders (Jeremiah 4:5-17). If God’s people do not want him as their protector, he will give them exactly what they ask. Despite how much it pains him, he will leave them to the powers they have chosen for themselves (Jeremiah 4:18-22). And the world, as God’s people know it, will be destroyed (Jeremiah 4:23-26). 

But God tells Jeremiah that if he can find just one person in all Judah willing to listen and obey, he will stop his coming judgment (Jeremiah 5:1). So he goes to Israel’s religious leaders, hoping that among those devoted to God’s words and laws he might find an obedient person and secure God’s forgiveness. But there isn’t one. Judah’s leaders know they are breaking God’s commands, don’t care, and don’t believe God will judge them (Jeremiah 5:2-6). Jeremiah quickly learns that Judah has abandoned all fidelity to God and even love of one another. Judah is full of not just idolatry but evil, injustice, exploitation, and fraudulence from the top down (Jeremiah 5:26-31). To Jeremiah’s horror, he realizes there is not one good person left in Judah, and nothing will stop God’s judgment (Jeremiah 5:7-13).

Failing to find one good person, God tells Jeremiah that every one of his prophecies will come to pass. Soon, an army will overshadow God’s people, strip them of their wealth, and drag them into exile (Jeremiah 5:14-25; Jeremiah 6:22-30). Jerusalem is so oppressive and violent that God will command the oncoming armies to forgo sleep and level their capital before another day dawns on their evil (Jeremiah 6:1-9). But Judah is so hard-hearted that they refuse to listen even when God tells them to run from his judgment and escape Jerusalem (Jeremiah 6:10-21). But despite this stubbornness, faithlessness, and evil, God says his love for his people has not been entirely exhausted. And he promises that some will survive his coming judgment and that one day his protection will be offered again (Jeremiah 4:27; 5:18). 

Where is the Gospel?

God told Jeremiah that he would forgive Judah’s sins and stop his coming justice if he could find one good person who would listen to and obey God, but Jeremiah couldn’t. Sadly, not much has changed. The New Testament tells us there has never been one good person who has fully kept God’s commands (Romans 3:23). If God’s promises of protection, care, and forgiveness all rest on finding just one good human, humanity should expect only judgment. 

But despite humanity’s chronic stubbornness, faithlessness, and evil, God, in love, sent his son Jesus to be born as a human and to listen and obey God in a way his people never could (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:1-5). He would be the one good man through whom God’s people would be forgiven, escape judgment, and receive his loving provision. Jesus lived a life of loyalty and obedience to God’s commands and desires (John 5:19; Luke 22:42). Jesus was the man Jeremiah was looking for! Jesus is the man who would save God’s people from their judgment.

But justice for humanity’s evil needed to be paid to protect us from God's judgment. So Jesus was forced outside the city of Jerusalem, killed, and exiled to a grave (John 19:16-17). He was destroyed just as Jeremiah predicted God’s people would be. But now that justice has been done there is no more threat of condemnation (Romans 8:1). Because of Jesus’ death, God’s people escape judgment, are forgiven, and promised God’s provision and care. In Jesus, we always have our one good man. Whenever we need God’s forgiveness, we have it—in Jesus. For all those who trust and are loyal to the good man Jesus, God promises that all judgment is paid, all disobedience forgiven, and everything we need will be provided. 

See For Yourself

So I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who judges evil. And may you see Jesus as the one good man who secures our forgiveness. "

",Website,Jeremiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Judah’s capital had been under siege from the superpower Babylon for months. But suddenly, Babylon’s forces withdraw, prompting Zedekiah, Judah’s cowardly king, to approach God’s prophet Jeremiah and ask for advice on what to do next (Jeremiah 37:1-5). And Jeremiah says that Babylon’s withdrawal is only temporary. Babylon will return and burn his city to the ground. Zedekiah must reject any prophets saying otherwise and repent in hopes of deliverance (Jeremiah 37:6-10). But he doesn’t. Instead, the captain of Zedekiah’s royal guard accuses Jeremiah of desertion and throws him in a dungeon (Jeremiah 37:11-16). Days later, the king summons Jeremiah in secret. The Babylonian army had returned, so Zedekiah wondered if God had given Jeremiah any new insight into the war's outcome. Jeremiah repeats what he said before and adds that the king will soon become a Babylonian prisoner of war. If the king wants Judah to survive, he has to submit to Babylon (Jeremiah 37:17). Jeremiah then demands better treatment. Not only has he been falsely accused of desertion, but unlike the king’s other counselors, his prophecies have all come true. But the king is again unwilling to listen to God’s prophet or overturn his captain's decision. Instead of freeing Jeremiah, he places him in an above-ground prison with a daily ration of bread (Jeremiah 37:18-21). 

While in prison, Jeremiah continues to prophesy that no military options will succeed, Jerusalem will be destroyed, and the only hope for its citizens is surrender (Jeremiah 38:1-3). The king’s advisors inform the king that Jeremiah’s defeatism is ruining the soldiers’ morale. He must be put to death (Jeremiah 38:4). Afraid of contradicting his advisors, the king allows them to throw Jeremiah into an empty pit to die in the mud (Jeremiah 38:5-6). But when one of the king’s foreign diplomats advocates for Jeremiah’s innocence, the king acquiesces and tells him to raise him out of the pit (Jeremiah 38:7-13).

The king summons Jeremiah again and asks for any updates from God (Jeremiah 38:14-16). But Jeremiah gives the same prophecy: Jerusalem will be destroyed, and surrender is the only option (Jeremiah 38:17-19). The king says he’s afraid of following God’s advice. But Jeremiah reassures Zedekiah that if he surrenders, God will protect him, his family, and the city he rules over (Jeremiah 38:20-23). Too afraid to act on Jeremiah’s words, Zedekiah swears him to secrecy (Jeremiah 38:24-28). Only days later, Babylon breaks through Jerusalem’s defenses, drags the king to a Babylonian prison, burns Jerusalem to the ground, and exiles all but the poorest to Babylon—just as Jeremiah predicted (Jeremiah 39:1-10). The only royal officials who escaped exile and remained in Jerusalem were Jeremiah and the foreign diplomat who listened to his message and rescued him from the pit (Jeremiah 39:11-18). 

Where is the Gospel?

Jeremiah’s incarceration and Zedekiah’s fall parallel the story of Joseph in the book of Genesis. Both Jeremiah and Joseph are thrown into pits (Genesis 37:24). The kings of their respective nations summon both (Genesis 41:14). Captains of royal guards falsely accuse both men (Genesis 39:20). Both prophesy the future (Genesis 41:25-27). And both are rescued from their prison by foreigners (Genesis 41:9-13). In both Jeremiah's and Joseph’s stories, the willingness of the king to listen to the prophet’s words set the kingdom's course. Pharaoh listened and obeyed Joseph’s words, and Egypt survived a famine (Genesis 41:56-57). But Zedekiah refused to listen to Jeremiah’s words three times, and Jerusalem burned. In both stories, recognizing and obeying God’s prophet in the pit determined the fate of a nation. We should want to be more like the listening Pharaoh than the cowardly Zedekiah.

We all have situations where we feel attacked and under siege or like the hopeless citizens of a city ruined by powers more powerful than we can control. God’s invitation is the same as it was for Pharaoh and Zedekiah. We must listen and obey his prophet, namely God’s prophet Jesus (Hebrews 1:1-3). Just like Joseph and Jeremiah, Jesus announced that the only way to live was by submission to a greater power (Matthew 22:37). For his prophecies and like his predecessors, Jesus was lowered into a pit that should have been his tomb (John 19:38-42). But God raised Jesus from the dead just as he raised Joseph and Jeremiah from their prisons (Matthew 28:6). Jesus is God’s ultimate risen prophet from the pit, and he stands ready to help, rescue, and grant resurrection life to all who feel harassed and ruined. So accept Jesus as God’s prophet, submit to his rule, obey his words, and experience your rescue.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who rescues those who trust his words. And may you see Jesus as the one who was raised from the dead to raise all of us to life with him."

",Website,Jeremiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

God’s people in Judah have abandoned God for the gods of other nations. God warns that this rejection of him and his protection will end in death. In hopes of shocking his people back to him, God tells Jeremiah to embody personally the coming destruction against Judah. Jeremiah must not get married or have children because soon all parents and children will lie dead under Babylonian swords (Jeremiah 16:1-4). Jeremiah can’t attend the funerals of his friends and relatives because he can’t show compassion for the people from whom God has chosen to remove his mercy (Jeremiah 16:5-7). Jeremiah can’t even attend dinner parties because soon God will stop all happiness in Judah (Jeremiah 16:8-9). As a harbinger of God’s judgment and in hopes of Judah’s repentance, Jeremiah embodies the coming disaster of God’s people. 

Some in Judah question the harshness of these judgments, but Jeremiah says they shouldn't be surprised. They have abandoned both God and the laws that govern his kingdom. God is justified in removing his protection and allowing their deportation (Jeremiah 16:10-13). But God also promises that a new day of deliverance and rescue will come after their exile (Jeremiah 16:14-15). God will liberate Judah from their oppressors, repay Babylon for their wartime cruelties, and judge them for seducing Judah with idolatry. And once Judah and her enemies are judged for their evil, God will begin a new global kingdom of worshipers loyal to him (Jeremiah 16:19-21). 

But for now, Judah refuses to listen to Jeremiah. They have carved their idolatry and disloyalty to God onto their hearts. So God says he will give Judah over to their enemies (Jeremiah 17:1-4). Judah is cursed to exile because they have followed their hearts away from God (Jeremiah 17:5-6). But Jeremiah prophesies that there is a way back from the curse of exile. If God’s people reject their idols and trust God again, God will make them like a fruit tree on the bank of a flowing river (Jeremiah 17:7-8). But Jeremiah knows the human heart is endlessly fickle and that God intimately knows all his people’s crooked motivations and desires (Jeremiah 17:9-11). Jeremiah can’t change their hearts, so Judah’s only hope is for God to transform his people (Jeremiah 17:12-13). Knowing this, Jeremiah begs God to save him and his nation (Jeremiah 17:14). He begs God to remove those in power who reject his message in hopes that God’s rescue and restoration will come soon (Jeremiah 17:15-18). 

Where is the Gospel?

God tells Jeremiah to live as a cursed man in hopes that God’s people will turn from their idolatry and return to God. However, the embodied prophecies of Jeremiah were not ultimately successful. They did not solve the problem of Judah’s hard hearts or prevent Babylon’s invasion. After all, only God can transform hearts. But Jeremiah’s prophecies show us the pattern by which God will transform humanity’s hearts. One day, God himself will embody the curse his people are owed and the rescue and restoration they can expect. 

So God sent not just another prophet but his son Jesus. Like Jeremiah, Jesus' life was one of much suffering and hardship. Still, it was at his death on a Roman cross that Jesus most fully embodied his people’s curse and rebellion (2 Corinthians 5:21). In his body, he took responsibility for all human evil and experienced God’s judgment (1 Peter 2:24). Jesus was cursed for his people and buried for our faithlessness and idolatry. But just as God promised Jeremiah that there would be a new day of rescue and a new day of deliverance from their enemies, Jesus rose from the dead. In so doing, Jesus was victorious over the power that leads our rebellious hearts to death. And now that he lives forever, Jesus stands ready to transform the hearts of all who come to him. By God’s power, all of God’s people can be like fruit trees on the banks of a river because Jesus has put to death our rebellion and transformed us by his cross and resurrection. Jesus is the living demonstration of the destruction of our curse, the embodied promise of eternal life, and the living God who can transform our hearts to love and trust him.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who judges all evil. And may you see Jesus as the one who embodies our sin and death so that we can live with God forever. "

Judah’s last king, Zedekiah, is under siege from Babylon. He has imprisoned Jeremiah for predicting the fall of his kingdom and campaigning for Judah to surrender (Jeremiah 32:1-2). Zedekiah interrogates Jeremiah and demands an explanation for his gloomy and unpatriotic prophecies (Jeremiah 32:3-5). Instead of responding directly, Jeremiah tells Zedekiah that God has recently told him to purchase some property (Jeremiah 32:6-14). Zedekiah would have laughed. Buying property while losing a land war is a terrible investment. But it’s God’s saying that Judah’s imminent defeat by Babylon is not the end of God’s people. God is asking Jeremiah to buy the land in faith that God’s people will once again own the land they are leaving behind (Jeremiah 32:15). 

In prayer, Jeremiah admits that he believes nothing is too hard for God, but he also says Judah's evil seems insurmountable. God rescued his people from Egyptian bondage and gave them the land his ancestors have lived in up to this moment (Jeremiah 32:16-22). And Judah has rejected the God who saved them. Jeremiah knows Judah deserves destruction, making it hard to be sure that God will give him a return on his investment. If Judah’s never been faithful, they won’t be faithful in the future, and God will have no reason to save them again (Jeremiah 32:23-25).

God responds to Jeremiah’s prayer and tells him he’s right. He has decreed Babylon’s invasion. Judah has been ungrateful, disloyal, and evil. From the king to the kingdom’s poor, everyone has spit in God’s face rather than bow to it. Judah still sacrifices their children on the altars of false gods (Jeremiah 32:26-35). But God says he is their God even when they don’t deserve it (Jeremiah 32:36-38). He tells Jeremiah he plans to save them from their oppressors and transform their hearts. He will make them faithful citizens who will experience his love forever (Jeremiah 32:39-41). His restoration will supersede his ruin, and every investment will be rewarded (Jeremiah 32:42-44).

God reiterates that Jerusalem will first be leveled. But after the destruction, God will heal it. He will forgive his people, bring them out of exile, and rebuild their nation (Jeremiah 33:1-10). Even though war is ravaging Jerusalem, life, joy, and worship will soon fill the city and the countryside around it (Jeremiah 33:11-14). God has not forgotten his promises to Zedekiah’s forefather, David. He promised King David that one of his sons would always rule over his people. So, God says he will cause a new branch to grow from Zedekiah’s family tree. As surely as the sun rises, God will crown a new son of David. He will be called “The Lord our Righteous Savior,” and he will fulfill every promise God has made to his people (Jeremiah 33:15-26). 

Where is the Gospel?

It would take over 400 years for Jeremiah’s prophecies to come true. But the branch from Zedekiah’s dying family tree and the son of David that God promised to Jeremiah arrived when Jesus was born. He was the Righteous Savior who rescued God’s people from their oppressors, forgave his people’s rebellion, transformed the hearts of faithless citizens, and inaugurated an era of eternal love. But Jesus' salvation did not happen as Jeremiah and many of his contemporaries expected. Jesus did not save his people by picking up swords or taking a throne in Jerusalem, but by dying on a cross and rising from the dead (John 18:36).

That’s because the true exile of God’s people was not political or geographic but spiritual. Their hearts were exiled from their heavenly king long before their bodies entered Babylon. The cause of Judah’s exile wasn’t a lack of military or leadership prowess but hearts chronically opposed to listening, trusting, and obeying God. Judah was exiled as punishment but also in preparation for a future spiritual restoration. Likewise Jesus was exiled to death both as punishment for his people's failures and as the final preparation for his people’s experience of God’s eternal love. On Jesus’ cross, all rebellion is punished and forgiven. Our hearts are transformed so that they listen, obey, and trust God (Hebrews 8:12). By his resurrection, we are guaranteed entrance into a kingdom of eternal love where no enemy or oppressor can take away what God has planned for his people (John 10:10). Jesus died on a cross and rose from the dead so our spiritual estrangement and rebellion against God could be eternally solved (2 Corinthians 5:19). And now that it has, God promised that one day he will make his Kingdom physical once again. One day soon, God will renew the entire earth, and we will own land in God’s New Creation, never to rebel, be harmed, or be exiled again (Revelation 21:5).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God whose restoration outweighs his ruin. And may you see Jesus as the one who was exiled for his people so that we can enter his eternal Kingdom. "

Jesus is the true Lord of Justice, the true Zedekiah. ",Website,Jeremiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Judah’s kings are preventing God’s people from experiencing his kingdom of justice and peace. So, in a collection of four prophecies, Jeremiah condemns Judah’s last king, Zedekiah, and the relatives who ruled before him. He promises God will raise a new leader for his people. 

Under siege from Babylon, Zedekiah asks Jeremiah to pray for God’s protection (Jeremiah 21:1-2). But for decades, Zedekiah and his family have abused their power, perpetrated injustice, abandoned orphans, neglected the poor, rejected God’s laws, done violence to foreigners, and sacrificed their children to secure the support of foreign gods and kings (Jeremiah 21:11-14). Jeremiah is blunt: God will not protect Zedekiah. The loss of his kingdom is his family’s fault (Jeremiah 22:1-7). And while the royal family dismisses Jeremiah’s critique, every nation knows it’s true (Jeremiah 22:8-10). Jeremiah tells Zedekiah he should not expect compassion from God but catastrophic defeat and exile (Jeremiah 21:3-7). And if citizens want to escape this judgment, their only hope is to abandon Zedekiah and surrender to Babylon (Jeremiah 21:8-10). 

Jeremiah then describes how Judah’s kingship has been corrupt for a long time and details how Zedekiah’s unjust predecessors all died. One of Zedekiah’s brothers was a greedy king. He made slaves of his people, and, like his brother, he refused to defend the poor and needy (Jeremiah 22:11-17). And for his greed and oppression, God deposed and exiled him to Egypt after ruling for only three months (2 Chronicles 36:2-4). Another of Zedekiah’s brothers made a string of failed military alliances. After a coup, he was exiled to a Babylonian prison for treason (2 Kings 24:1-2). Zedekiah’s evil nephew also ruled for only three months before willingly surrendering to Babylon, never to set foot in Judah again (Jeremiah 22:24-30; 2 Kings 24:8-17). Zedekiah’s family tree is full of unjust kings who rebelled against God. Every one of them was judged for their role in scattering God’s people like sheep among the wolves of the earth (Jeremiah 22:18-23:3). But speaking to his fellow citizens, Jeremiah says that God has plans to gather his scattered people once again and restore their kingdom under the reign of a new and good king from the ancient line of David. Unlike Zedekiah and his family, he will reign wisely; he will be called “The Lord of Justice” and begin a new era of peace and freedom for God’s people in their own land (Jeremiah 23:3-8).

Where is the Gospel?

In Hebrew, the title “Lord of Justice” sounds very similar to “Zedekiah.” But Zedekiah and his family were unwise rulers and evil leaders. Even though they were all sons of David and part of God’s chosen dynasty, Jeremiah and his generation would have to wait for another son from the chosen royal line. The son of David, who would rule wisely and lead his scattered people to safety, is Jesus. Jesus is the true Lord of Justice, the true Zedekiah. 

When Jesus first announced his kingdom had arrived, he said he had come to do justice for the poor, the imprisoned, the blind, and the oppressed (Luke 4:18-19). He came to share his rule not with the powerful but with the hungry, persecuted, and humble (Matthew 5:3-10). Jesus came to find the lost sheep that Zedekiah and his family scattered (Matthew 15:24). And to prove the point, Jesus brought his kingdom of justice, peace, and freedom to bear by healing the sick, curing the demonized, and raising the dead (Matthew 15:30). Jesus is the true King of God’s people and the “Lord of Justice'' Jeremiah prophesied. So, Jesus invites all of us to surrender to him.

",Website,Jeremiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jeremiah compares two events, separated by ten years, side by side. The first is faithless King Zedekiah’s temporary emancipation of slaves in Judah. The second is a wine-tasting Jeremiah hosts with a group of nomads called the Rekabites. Together, they teach Judah what it means to be faithful to the agreements (called covenants) they make with God and the consequences for failing to follow through with them.

While Jerusalem and its nearby military outposts are under siege from Babylon, Jeremiah declares that he will be defeated in battle, captured, and see his nation fall (Jeremiah 34:1-7). Perhaps looking to prevent this outcome, Zedekiah makes a covenant with God. Zedekiah announces that all slaves should be set free, just as God described in his ancient laws. He then cuts a calf in half and solemnly swears that if anyone breaks this covenant, they will be split in two, just like the young cow. The slave owners of Judah immediately accept the terms of this covenant and free their slaves (Jeremiah 34:8-10). Shortly after this, Babylon pauses its siege against Jerusalem. But with the crisis seemingly over, Judah’s slave owners forget their covenant and force their slaves to return (Jeremiah 34:11). God is furious. Not only are they breaking the terms of the covenant they have just made, but they have forgotten the reason Judah had those laws in the first place. They were once slaves in Egypt, and God rescued them (Jeremiah 34:12-16). God says Judah will get what they deserve for their forgetfulness and fickle faithfulness. They proclaimed false freedom to their people, so God says Judah is free—free to die however they’d like (Jeremiah 34:17). And since they made their covenant with God over the severed body of a calf, God says that’s precisely what their nation will become. Babylon will return and tear their city apart (Jeremiah 34:18-22). 

Zedekiah and Judah’s covenant unfaithfulness to God is then immediately contrasted with the faithfulness of a little-known nomadic tribe called the Rekabites, who were forced into Jerusalem by the war with Babylon (Jeremiah 35:11). God tells Jeremiah to invite the leaders of this tribe into the temple and pour them some wine (Jeremiah 35:1-5). But once they sit down, they refuse Jeremiah’s hospitality. They explain that their forefather placed them under a covenant. They would continue to live in Judah provided they never drank wine, built homes, or owned land (Jeremiah 35:6-10). God points out that the Rekabite founder spoke once, and generations later, his descendants still follow his commands. At the same time, he has repeatedly told Judah to remember their covenant to no effect (Jeremiah 35:12-16). God says that Judah will be exiled for their failure to listen to God’s covenant, but the Rekabites will be permitted to live in Judah as long as they’d like (Jeremiah 35:17-19).

Where is the Gospel?

The Rekabites are a good example for us to follow—we should be faithful to our agreements, especially with God. But Judah is a more realistic picture of our moral and spiritual condition. When in a crisis, we are quick to make deals with God and promise to do better, try harder, and recommit ourselves to his laws. But when the crisis ends, we quickly forget what we promised, or else decide God’s laws are too difficult to obey consistently and just give up. Judah’s problem is our problem, too—we are more fickle than faithful. 

This is why God sent us a King better than the faithless Zedekiah. God sent us his son to make a new covenant between him and his people. Unlike Zedekiah, who abandoned his covenant with God when it no longer seemed necessary, Jesus was faithful even when the price of God’s new covenant would cost him greatly. Like Jeremiah prophesied about Judah, Jesus was torn apart, his body destroyed, and exiled to a tomb. But it was through his torn body and spilled blood that Jesus made a new covenant (Luke 22:20). Jesus was like the Rekabites. He did precisely what his father commanded (John 5:19). Jesus was faithful where Zedekiah was not, securing a place for us in God’s Kingdom forever. 

Jesus is a good king and has been faithful in providing everything needed to include us in his Kingdom. So we must trust him. Like the Rekabites who accepted the terms of their forefather's covenant, we must accept the covenant Jesus secured by his death and pledge allegiance to him and his Kingdom above all others. And when we do, Jesus promises that we will be free, freed to live without fear of death or being torn apart. We are free to live with God forever because of the covenant his son—and our King—has made and kept.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is always faithful to his covenants. And may you see Jesus as the one who is our faithful covenant-making King."

",Website,Jeremiah Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

God is punishing the people of Judah for their idolatry and evil with a severe drought. The ground is cracking, crops are withering, and even the hardiest wild animals are starving (Jeremiah 14:1-6). The whole nation is mourning the death and devastation that God’s judgment has brought. So, in a series of prayers, Jeremiah prays to God on Judah’s behalf and asks him to lessen their suffering. Jeremiah admits Judah has rebelled and asks God to relieve their suffering, not because they deserve it, but because God’s reputation is on the line (Jeremiah 14:7). In the past, God described himself as the “hope of Israel'' and his people’s “savior.” So Jeremiah asks God to be true to his ancient names again, rescue the people he loves, and send rain (Jeremiah 14:8-9).

But God tells Jeremiah the famine is fair. Judah’s explicit evil and idolatry cannot be swept under the rug. Judah must pay for its crimes (Jeremiah 14:10). His verdict is final. And he promises that if the famine doesn’t destroy Judah, he will send an army for the survivors. Jeremiah must stop praying for Judah’s rescue and join him in announcing Judah’s destruction (Jeremiah 14:11-18). But despite God’s command, Jeremiah writes another prayer on his people’s behalf. Again, he acknowledges Judah’s deep guilt and begs God to treat them not as their actions demand but for his reputation (Jeremiah 14:19-22). But once again, God says Jeremiah’s prayers won’t stop his judgment against his defiant and guilty people (Jeremiah 15:1-4). 

Jeremiah finally obeys and joins God in announcing the fall of Judah’s obstinately evil nation (Jeremiah 15:5-9). But delivering these prophecies of doom invites immediate opposition from those in power. Overwhelmed by both the gloominess of his warnings and the severity of their attacks, Jeremiah wishes he had never been born (Jeremiah 15:10). But God promises Jeremiah that he will protect and deliver him from his persecutors (Jeremiah 15:11-14). 

Jeremiah shoots back that he has already dutifully spoken every word he’s given him, and that’s only brought him pain (Jeremiah 15:16-17). Jeremiah asks how God can be so calloused to his faithful suffering and why, like a mirage, he promises waters of relief but delivers only sand (Jeremiah 15:18). Gently, God rebukes Jeremiah. He tells him to turn away from speaking such harsh words against him so that he might, in turn, give Jeremiah new words of encouragement and consolation (Jeremiah 15:19). Jeremiah was born to be God’s messenger, and only by joining God in announcing judgment will Jeremiah know God is faithful to his name, vindicate his reputation, and protect Jeremiah from his persecutors (Jeremiah 15:20-21).

Where is the Gospel?

Jeremiah is hesitant to join God in his denouncements against Judah. But joining God in his judgment against Judah is the only way Jeremiah will experience God as the “hope of Israel'' and his personal “savior.” Ironically, accepting and proclaiming the announcement of God’s judgment is the only way to be saved. 

God’s ultimate prophet, Jesus asked God the same question as Jeremiah. Like Jeremiah, Jesus announced the fall of Jerusalem and faced violent opposition from the religious leadership of Judah (Mark 13:1-2). When faced with the reality of his quickly approaching death, Jesus prays. He asks God if there is another way for God’s people to be saved other than his destruction. And just as God said to Jeremiah, God tells Jesus, “No” (Luke 22:39-44). The only way Jesus and his people will experience God as the hope of Israel and as their savior is by accepting the deadly judgment of a Roman cross. Jesus carries God’s message of judgment and dies. But just as God promised Jeremiah, God protects Jesus. Three days later, God vindicated his reputation as the hope and savior of his people and raised Jesus from his tomb (Acts 2:24). Jesus was saved from death by accepting God’s judgment. 

And the same holds true for us as well. The only way we are saved from God’s judgment against our own obstinate evil is if we accept and proclaim that God has judged evil on the cross of Jesus. Jesus did not simply die as our example but in our place. And when we accept and proclaim his good news of judgment, we will be saved from our persecutors, raised from the dead, and experience God as our hope and savior. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who judges his people. And may you see Jesus as the one who accepts God’s judgment so we can experience his protection and eternal life."

In Jeremiah’s time, the office of God’s prophet was corrupted. The privileged position of God’s prophet was filled with adulterous, evil, and unjust people who presumed to speak for God when he had not spoken. As far as we know, only one good prophet is left—Jeremiah. And God has commissioned him to condemn Israel’s false prophets, defend his word, and announce God’s coming judgment against them and their presumption (Jeremiah 23:9-12). 

In a public renunciation of Judah’s false prophets, Jeremiah admits there have always been faithless prophets. But the ones currently in Judah are uniquely evil. Worse than the false prophets who came before them, the prophets in Jerusalem claim to speak on behalf of the true God, only to lie in his name and give religious justifications for their evil (Jeremiah 23:14). To God, the prophets of Jerusalem are worse than the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah that he burned to the ground. Jeremiah says these prophets should expect nothing less than the same kind of judgment (Jeremiah 23:15).

Israel’s citizens must also reject these false prophets’ prophecies and listen to Jeremiah. God has decreed that judgment and devastation are on the horizon, and despite what their leaders are saying, nothing will stop this (Jeremiah 23:16-17). Jeremiah alone has God’s words in his mouth, and the coming days will soon prove him right (Jeremiah 23:18-20). Besides, the prophets currently advising the kings of Judah have consistently abandoned God’s laws, sanctioned idolatry, and justified evil. Judah must reject their words and accept God’s words in Jeremiah’s mouth (Jeremiah 23:21-22).

To Jeremiah, these false prophets and their prophecies are like straw, and God’s word is a fire. And God has commissioned Jeremiah to defend his word and burn their falsehoods from the minds of God’s people (Jeremiah 23:25-31). God has only one message for these false prophets—judgment and exile are coming. All would-be prophets need to stop speaking immediately because this is the last word God will ever speak to them (Jeremiah 23:33-40). 

Where is the Gospel?

In every age, there are false prophets and teachers who claim to speak on God’s behalf but wink at evil and dismiss God’s judgment. Most of the New Testament letters deal with some sort of spiritual successor to the false prophets mentioned in Jeremiah. We can feel helpless as we watch more and more of the teachers we once trusted abandon God’s Word when the cultural winds shift or the people in power change. But Jeremiah gives us hope. No false prophet will stand forever. God always defends his word, and false teaching withers as God’s word is spoken. Ultimately, Jeremiah proved the false teachers wrong when his prophecies came true, and Judah was exiled. God defended his words in Jeremiah’s mouth by making them come to pass. 

But God does not speak to us through prophets like Jeremiah anymore because he has spoken to us more fully and finally in his son, Jesus (Hebrews 1:1-4). Like Jeremiah, Jesus was opposed by religious leaders and false prophets who did not believe that he had come to overturn their corruption (John 2:19-22; Luke 19:45-47). They thought that by killing Jesus, they could stop his prophecies from coming true. But it didn’t. Jesus rose from his exile in the grave just as he prophesied. God defended his Word; history proved Jesus right, and he destroyed the lies of his enemies.

God always defends his Word. God’s Word is always victorious over the lies of our cultural moment. God’s Word always brings to justice those who presumptuously claim to speak on his behalf. Like fire burns straw, God's Word will always conquer lies. We have no reason to fear our time's false teachers and prophets because the true teacher and prophet Jesus sits in heaven. And he will always perfectly defend his Word and people from the lies that attack them. We don’t need to fear the lies outside because Jesus—God’s Word and Truth—lives forever.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who defends his Word. And may you see Jesus as the ultimate prophet who judges all who speak falsely."

Judah was meant to trust God and obey his commands, but they haven’t. So God gives Jeremiah two messages that communicate Judah’s guilt before him and foreshadow their coming exile. In the first message, God tells Jeremiah to buy underwear and to wear it without washing it. Jeremiah obeys (Jeremiah 13:1-2). God then tells Jeremiah to walk far away and bury his unwashed underwear. Jeremiah obeys again (Jeremiah 13:3-4). Finally, a few days later, God tells Jeremiah to recover his hidden loincloth. But it's decayed and rotted when he takes it out of the ground (Jeremiah 13:5-7). God then explains to Jeremiah the meaning of this enacted prophecy. Just as his underwear had rotted, Judah had rotted and spoiled. Just as Jeremiah wandered far from home to bury his loincloth, Judah buried their faithfulness to God by importing idols from distant lands (Jeremiah 13:8-10). Just as underwear is meant to cling to bodies, Judah was meant to cling to their God. But Judah has ruined herself, is unfit to cling to God anymore, and will soon be thrown out (Jeremiah 13:11-12).

God reiterates Judah’s guilt and their coming exile in the second message. God tells Jeremiah to tell Judah that every wine bottle will soon be filled with wine (Jeremiah 13:12). Confused, the people respond by saying: “Of course, they will be. That’s what wine bottles are for” (Jeremiah 13:13). But Jeremiah isn’t talking about groceries, he's talking about people. In judgment, God will fill every king, priest, prophet, and citizen to the brim with uncut drunkenness. They will stagger over one another and, in their frenzy, smash their nation to pieces. God will host no intervention as his people destroy themselves (Jeremiah 13:14).

Jeremiah begs his fellow citizens to listen to his warnings before the doom and darkness he’s prophesied come true (Jeremiah 13:15-17). Soon, Judah’s king will be deposed, towns will be boarded up and emptied, and Judah will be taken to exile (Jeremiah 13:18-19). Their only hope is to cling to God once again. A northern nation they currently consider an ally will betray them and send an army to destroy Judah (Jeremiah 13:20-21). Judah shouldn’t be surprised by this. The nation that has so treacherously and shamelessly abandoned its God should expect treachery and shame in return (Jeremiah 13:22). God will see to it himself. Judah will be stripped, exposed, and laid bare for the rotten pile of useless laundry she’s become (Jeremiah 13:23-27). 

Where is the Gospel?

Jeremiah’s images are uncomfortable. They ask us to imagine that God’s people, at their best, are like underwear clinging to a man’s body and, at their worst, decaying and rotting laundry. They tell us to imagine God intoxicating his people in judgment and sending armies to ravage and plunder them. But these images are meant to make us feel uncomfortable. Judah was numb to their idolatry and calloused towards God. These images are intended to shock them and us, hoping that we will see our shameful behavior in all its depravity.

Similarly, the crucifixion of Jesus means to make all who read about it equally uncomfortable. Just as Judah’s spiritual condition was imputed onto the images of underwear, drunkenness, destruction, and nudity, our spiritual condition was imputed to Jesus on the cross. He embodied our guilt and shame (2 Corinthians 5:21). He was stripped, exposed, and laid bare on the cross. His bloodied and spoiled undergarments were gambled over (Matthew 27:35). God’s son, the only one who ever genuinely clung to God, was marched outside of his city, and his body was discarded and buried (Hebrews 13:12-14). The crucifixion of Jesus is an offensive and shocking visual prophecy of the depravity of our disobedience. And while Jeremiah held out no hope of these things for Judah, the cross is where God’s forgiveness and restoration are secured for all people (Hebrews 10:12). Jesus didn’t just die as a living picture of the horror of our sin, but he died in our place. He was exposed and discarded in death so we would not have to be. He was stripped of his dignity so we could be clothed in his faithfulness (Revelation 19:6-8). In Jesus, all God’s judgments were carried out so that we could cling to Jesus as closely as he has clung to his Father since the beginning of time (John 17:21).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who wants you to be close to him. And may you see Jesus as the one who died and was discarded so we could come close. "

Shortly after Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, sacked Jerusalem and exiled its people, God gave Jeremiah a vision of two baskets of figs that portray two very different futures for God’s people (Jeremiah 24:1-2). The first basket is full of ripe and juicy figs. They represent the exiles who have left Judah and gone to Babylon. God will protect them while in captivity and one day bring them back to their homeland, where he will rebuild and replant all they have lost. Once they have returned, God will also transform them. They were exiled for their hard-hearted resistance to God and his laws, but on the day they return, God will cause their hearts to love him and his laws—and so they will never be exiled again (Jeremiah 24:3-7). But the second basket is full of inedible rotted figs. They represent those who did not go into exile but attempted to preserve Judah’s statehood. For their failure to accept God’s judgment, these figs will be destroyed, never to return to the homeland God had given them (Jeremiah 24:8-10).

Jeremiah then recounts how he had accurately predicted this over a decade earlier and begged Judah to change course (Jeremiah 25:1-3). Before Jeremiah’s time, God sent many prophetic servants who implored Judah to turn from their evil and idolatry or lose the land God had given them (Jeremiah 25:4-6). But since Judah didn’t listen, God has chosen a new servant, Nebuchadnezzar, to convince his people to change their ways (Jeremiah 25:7-9). Unlike God’s prophets, he would be a brutal monarch who would leave desolate all in his path. But Jeremiah also predicts Nebuchadnezzar will only rule for 70 years, and God’s people will be restored to their land (Jeremiah 25:10-14). If Jeremiah was right about Judah’s destruction, God’s people can also be sure the countdown to Judah’s restoration has already begun. Instead of resisting Babylon’s imperial power, they should submit to it in the hope of one day returning to their homeland and restoring their relationship with God.

Then, in a new vision, God tells Jeremiah to take a cup of wine spiked with God’s wrath and force all the nations of the earth to drink and get drunk on it. This vision is Jeremiah’s first prophecy to people outside Judah, and it represents how God will judge human evil throughout the world (Jeremiah 25:15-16). Starting with Judah, nation after nation will drink God’s fatal cup, and nation after nation will fall under Babylon’s sword (Jeremiah 25:17-25). But eventually, Babylon will drink this cup too, and even it will fall (Jeremiah 25:26). Jeremiah’s message to the nations is that none are exempt from God’s total justice, especially when the first to drink God’s cup of judgment are those he loves most in Judah (Jeremiah 25:27-29). None will be spared because not even his people escape the sword (Jeremiah 25:30-38). 

Where is the Gospel? 

God’s justice is impartial; not even God’s servants are exempt from his justice. Jeremiah told the world's nations to pay attention to how God punished his people because it foreshadowed a day of judgment against all people. We see a similar dynamic on display on the cross of Jesus. 

God’s ultimate chosen person and servant was not a king or a prophet but his son. Out of love for his rebellious people, God sent his beloved son Jesus into the world to be judged (John 12:47). The night before he died, Jesus even asked God to remove the cup of wrath he was about to drink under Roman swords (Luke 22:42). But Jesus drank the cup willingly. As he died, God’s perfect justice against the world’s evil, oppression, and idolatry was doled out on him (Isaiah 53:5-11). God’s son was destroyed by Rome, just as God exiled his people to Babylon (Matthew 27:46). The cross is a warning to all people of the world—if God did not spare his only son from his justice and wrath, he will not spare anyone else.

But Jesus’ death on the cross is far more than a warning. Jesus’ death began the restoration between God and his people. On the cross, Jesus was more than an example. He was a substitute. God judged all his people’s evil in Jesus so that God’s people would never need to fear his judgment again. Jesus drank the cup of God’s wrath to the dregs, and there is nothing left to drink for all those who submit to God’s son and servant, Jesus. And now Jesus offers a new cup to all of us, not of wrath but of restored relationship and love (Luke 22:20).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who judges evil. And may you see Jesus who drank the cup of God’s wrath in our place. "

The book of Lamentations is a series of five anonymous acrostic poems that lament Babylon’s invasion and destruction of Israel. Lamentations 3 is the central poem, and in the center of this central poem the author gives us the reason for his hope even in the middle of God’s judgment. God is not angry. God is love (Lamentations 3:32-33).

But first the author describes the destruction of Jerusalem in terms of his own personal experience. To him, God has been a cruel shepherd. God has turned his rod of protection into a weapon (Lamentations 3:1). The author’s bones are broken, his skin flayed (Lamentations 3:4). Like a jailor, God has chained him up in an inescapable cell where no one can hear his screams (Lamentations 3:7-9). Like a predator, God has stalked and mangled him (Lamentations 3:10-12). God has impaled his vital organs (Lamentations 3:13). With no strength left, any hope the author once had is dead (Lamentations 3:18). Under God’s judgment Israel’s memories are bitter (Lamentations 3:19). But bitterness has not always been Israel’s experience with God. The author remembers God’s past goodness. He intentionally places old memories of God’s enduring love, his daily mercies, and great faithfulness next to his suffering (Lamentations 3:22-23).

God doesn’t afflict the guilty from his heart. No matter how much Israel might have sinned, the author knows it is alien to God’s character to reject his people forever (Lamentations 3:31). God won’t use Israel’s sin as an excuse to walk away. God only causes grief if he must, but his compassion and love are unrestrained (Lamentations 3:32). The deepest parts of God are not angry. God is love (Lamentations 3:33). 

The author knows Israel is guilty. The author knows she has rebelled against God. The author looks around his ruined city and knows God’s forgiveness is not yet a reality (Lamentations 3:42). The Babylonians are currently victorious (Lamentations 3:45-46). But in his past God heard his prayers, took up his cause, and rescued him from his enemies (Lamentations 3:55, 58). In confidence, he asks God to do the same again. He asks God to see the wrongs done to him by Babylon. He asks God to hear the insults he endures. And he asks God to do to Babylon what Babylon has done to Israel (Lamentations 3:64).

Where is the Gospel?

Often we think that when we sin, God is far away. We think we can't complain about our suffering because we are getting what we deserve. We think God’s distance is justified. After all, isn’t that how we would respond to a partner, spouse, or loved one who betrayed us as Israel betrayed God? 

But the central verses of this central poem tell us God does not use our sin as an excuse to walk away. No. Unlike us, God does not abandon his betrayer (Lamentations 3:31). Unlike us, God’s compassion outweighs his anger (Lamentations 3:32; Exodus 34:7). Neither punishment nor judgment come from God’s heart (Lamentations 3:33). His heart is full of faithfulness, mercy, and enduring love. The best indicator of God’s heart for his people is not his current judgment, but his past faithfulness. God is consistent. That’s why the author believes God must soon take up his cause and rescue him again. God’s love demands he rescue the guilty ones he afflicts.

And as with Israel, so with Jesus. On the cross, Jesus became guilty like us (2 Corinthians 5:21). But God took up Jesus’ cause and rescued him from death (Acts 2:24). God’s faithfulness to his own character demands not rejection but resurrection. And now Jesus’ cross and empty tomb are new memories for the people of God. When all we can call to mind or see around us is death, suffering, and pain; when God seems like a cruel shepherd leading us into valleys of death, or like a predator hunting us for sins we’ve committed, we can call to mind Jesus’ death and resurrection. We can remember that God rescues the guilty ones he afflicts. Our suffering, like our sin, will end. And therefore we have hope that God does not afflict us from his heart, but always brings new mercies to those who cry out to him. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God whose love demands he rescue the guilty ones he afflicts. And may you see Jesus as the one who takes up our cause and rescues us from our sin and suffering. "

Jeremiah writes a series of letters to God’s people exiled in Babylon, offering the hope of a “new covenant.” A covenant was an ancient treaty that defined the conditions and consequences of a relationship between two nations. 

Jeremiah says that while Judah’s exile is the deserved consequence for failing their first covenant, God will soon end their captivity, return them to their land, and make a new one (Jeremiah 30:1-3). God sees their anguish and suffering under Babylonian rule, and he promises that he will soon rescue his people and cause their captors to bow before a new king he will place on Jerusalem’s throne (Jeremiah 30:4-10). Jeremiah explains that while God is responsible for Judah’s exile, it was always meant to prepare them for a new and better future (Jeremiah 30:11-24). Even after all their failure and punishment, God still loves them and wants to be in a covenant relationship with them (Jeremiah 31:1-3). 

Jeremiah then describes what that new covenant will entail. For centuries, the twelve tribes of God’s people were divided by civil war, but God promised to unite the warring tribes so they could all worship God together again (Jeremiah 31:3-6). No matter where the nations have scattered them, God, like a good shepherd, will gather all his people back. And not even the blind and lame of his flock will be forgotten in the season of abundance and bounty he intends to bring (Jeremiah 31:7-14). Jeremiah then imagines God approaching Rachel, one of the founding mothers of Judah. She is weeping over her people’s exile, and the death of her descendants (Jeremiah 31:15). But God tells Rachel to stop crying because, in this new covenant, he will return all her children and fulfill the promises God had made to her (Jeremiah 31:16-17).

Changing the metaphor, God says that his new covenant will transform Judah from a prostitute daughter into a virgin bride (Jeremiah 31:21-22). To God, his first covenant with Judah was like vows exchanged on a wedding day (Jeremiah 31:31-32). So, in this new covenant, God promises to rewrite his vows on his bride’s heart. No one will have to be reminded of God’s love, and all past unfaithfulness will be forgotten (Jeremiah 31:33-34). And the only way this new covenant can be broken is if the sun stops burning and the stars fall from the sky. And nothing will prevent God’s people from living with him and enjoying his love and protection forever (Jeremiah 31:35-40).

Where is the Gospel?

Jeremiah is the only book in the Old Testament that mentions the “new covenant,” but it is not the first time the idea of a new covenant is present. Right after God makes his first covenant with his people, God predicts their faithlessness to that covenant, an inevitable exile, their eventual return, and the transformed hearts he intends to give them once they do (Deuteronomy 30:1-10). While Jeremiah calls it “new,” it has always been God’s intention to create people with transformed hearts and minds who can live with him and enjoy his love forever. 

The first time the New Testament speaks of a “new covenant” is when Jesus lifts a cup of wine during the Jewish feast of Passover and declares that in his coming death, the new covenant Jeremiah spoke of would come to pass (Luke 22:20; 1 Corinthians 11:25). The Passover remembered God’s liberation of Israel from Egyptian slavery and the events leading up to God making the first covenant. Jesus was saying that his death would be a new liberation from hearts enslaved to faithlessness and evil. In his blood and by his death, he was providing a way for God’s people to be forgiven, transformed, and to experience his love forever. When Jesus died, God’s people were liberated, and a new covenant was made (Hebrews 8:13). 

This new covenant is not limited to the tribes of God’s people. It’s inclusive of both the healthy and lame, seeing and blind, Jews and non-Jews. It’s available to all, not based on ethnicity but on faith and a shared trust that Jesus is the king who will rule all God’s people one day, just as Jeremiah said. As Judah proved, you do not have to be holy, pure, or good to join this Kingdom. In Jesus’ Kingdom, God transforms even the worst of us into his spotless bride and promises to love us forever despite our actions.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has made a new covenant. And may you see Jesus as the one who has died to secure God’s protection and love forever. "

The book of Lamentations is a series of five anonymous acrostic poems that lament Babylon’s invasion of Israel. In the previous poems, each letter of the Hebrew alphabet is given three couplets to express a thought. But Lamentations’ fourth poem has only two couplets per thought, and Lamentations 5 has only one. Lamentations 5 doesn’t follow the alphabet either. These structural changes make it feel as if the poems are dissolving. It’s as if the author has no energy left to continue his craft, and only sees the total reversal of Israel’s former glory.

Their once-precious temple is now rubble (Lamentations 4:2). Their capital is a place where hyenas care for their young better than Jerusalem’s mothers (Lamentations 4:3). Parents steal food from their children—or worse, boil them for food (Lamentations 4:4, 10). The clothes of the opulently dressed are tattered and stained with ash (Lamentations 4:5). Once beautiful princes are wrung dry by grief and dehydration (Lamentations 4:7-8). And those skewered in battle are better off than those who remain alive (Lamentations 4:9). 

In part, their current situation is due to the sins of Jerusalem’s ruling class. The hands of Israel’s prophets and the robes of God’s priests were so soaked in innocent blood that Babylon felt it was their duty to rid the world of their evil (Lamentations 4:13-15). And so before the twin terrors of God and the armies of Babylon, Israel and her leaders fall (Lamentations 4:16, 19-20). There is nothing left. But in the desolation of Jerusalem, in the ruin of her temple, and in the assassination of her leaders, Israel’s judgment is over. There is nothing left for God to judge (Lamentations 4:11). Surely, her exile must end (Lamentations 4:22a).

In that severe and dim hope, and for the first time in these five poems, the people of Israel speak. Together, they ask God to recognize their suffering and exhaustion (Lamentations 5:1, 5). They beg God to see their children’s starvation, their daughters’ rape, and their sons’ slavery (Lamentations 5:10-13). The loss of their king prompts Israel to confess her sin and confess that only God is king forever (Lamentations 5:16, 18-19). And if God is still on his throne, how can he forget the people he has loved (Lamentations 5:20)? Even though God has rightfully rejected Israel, even though God is right to be angry with Israel’s evil, and even though Israel is looking down the barrel of decades if not centuries of oppression and exile, Israel nevertheless asks God to renew and restore his relationship with her (Lamentations 5:21-22). 

Where is the Gospel?

The book of Lamentations doesn’t record any response from God. He lets Israel speak her sorrow from A-Z until even the poet runs out of letters. God neither offers justifications for his actions nor comfort to the grieving. In a way, this dignifies Israel’s sorrow. If God were to give a divine justification for his actions, they would have to stop lamenting. Their suffering is deserved. God said so. Instead, God’s silence turns up the volume on human suffering and lets those in pain be clearly heard. But God’s silence also makes us wonder if our suffering means God has rejected us. It makes us wonder if God will forever refuse to answer our pain.

But God has not only dignified human suffering, he places the cries of the destitute in his own mouth. By including the book of Lamentations in the Bible, Israel’s laments have now become God’s laments. His people’s deepest sorrow has eternally become God’s Word. By remaining silent and yet including Lamentations in Scripture, God makes human sorrow his own. The cries of agony, despair, and questioning that Lamentations records are now the agonies, despair, and questions of God.

And in Jesus the voice of God has become human (John 1:14). The sufferings of God’s people aren’t just spoken but carried in his body (John 20:27). Jesus identifies not as a silent God above his people, but as a Son of Man suffering with his people. Like his people he cries out to a God who remains silent (Matthew 27:46). His people’s nation dies in exile, so Jesus dies on his cross. We no longer need to wonder at God’s answer to our pain. He joins us in it. And if God has joined us in our suffering, guilt, and pain, God has not rejected us. God has answered us in Jesus.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is sometimes silent. And may you see Jesus as the one who suffers for you so that your suffering might end. "

Much of Proverbs is made up of individual or small collections of sayings meant to be enjoyed in isolation from the verses around them. But it’s also valuable to zoom out and collect all that Proverbs teaches about a particular topic. Today we’ll look at pride and humility.

The book of Proverbs is blunt about pride—God hates it (Proverbs 6:16-17). God is dedicated to tearing down the homes of the proud with the same ferocity that he protects the humble (Proverbs 15:25). Solomon warns his readers that God will punish prideful people (Proverbs 16:5).

God hates pride because pride is never private. Pride inevitably leads to violence (Proverbs 21:24). And that violence is normally directed at the weak, timid, and disadvantaged. This is why some proverbs contrast God’s destruction of the proud with his protection of the disenfranchised (Proverbs 16:18-19). 

The antidote to pride is humility. Solomon says we get both humility and wisdom when we fear the Lord (Proverbs 1:7, 22:4). In fact, humility comes before wisdom just like pride comes before a fall (Proverbs 11:2).

Proverbs tells us humility is wisely refusing to trust our claims about right and wrong, leaving those determinations entirely to God (Proverbs 3:5-7). When we humbly accept God’s words and instructions above our own, we gain honor and avoid shame (Proverbs 15:33).  

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus, in one of his confrontations with the Pharisees, calls out their massive pride. Their pride causes them to neglect the poor; it even shows up in their seating arrangements (Luke 14:7 Proverbs 25:6-7). So Jesus tells a story about a wedding where a guest presumes upon his relationship with the groom and sits at the family’s table, only to be shamed and humiliated when asked to sit elsewhere (Luke 14:9). 

We’re just like the proud Pharisees. We presume our place in history. We assume our intelligence or some other qualification or life experience grants us the authority to sit wherever we want. And our favorite seat is normally the one that decides between wisdom and foolishness, between right and wrong. But both Jesus and the book of Proverbs warn us that it's like sitting in the groom’s chair at a wedding—everyone will watch as we’re seated where we truly belong. 

Those who exalt themselves will be humbled. But Jesus also says those who humble themselves will be exalted (Luke 14:11). On the cross, Jesus takes the lowest and most humiliating seat at the table (Philippians 2:8). Jesus died a shameful death for crimes he did not commit; for pride he did not have. But God raises Jesus from the dead and seats a humble Jesus in place of honor. He guarantees humility’s final reward (Luke 14:10). When we humble ourselves, we’re promised that we will experience honor instead of shame as God raises us from our low places and seats us at his right hand in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6). 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is humble. And may you see Jesus as the one entrusted with God’s wisdom so that we might receive his honor."

Psalms 9 and 10 were traditionally read as a single unit. Both psalms praise God as a good King. God sees both the oppressors and the oppressed, both the wicked who ignore him and the righteous who seek him (Psalm 9:8).

The wicked in the world believe there is no God (Psalm 10:4). Far from rejoicing that there is a final, good judge, they reject the idea that there is a judge at all. In the mind of the wicked and the oppressors, none of their deeds will ever be called into account (Psalm 10:13). 

While the wicked ignore God, the righteous seek him out (Psalm 9:10). While the wicked seem to succeed, the righteous suffer (Psalm 9:13). 

The wicked scheme up ways to exploit the marginalized (Psalm 10:9). Their speech is constantly filled with sin, mischief, lies, and curses (Psalm 10:7). 

But David rejoices that there is a King who judges with righteousness, despite the arrogance of the wicked or the suffering of the righteous (Psalm 10:16). God will bring the evildoer to an end by giving them what they deserve (Psalm 10:15). 

But God will also hear the cries of the afflicted (Psalm 10:17). He will bring restitution and restoration to the fatherless and the oppressed (Psalm 10:18a). God will be their ultimate shelter and protection (Psalm 9:9). 

The key difference between the wicked who are destroyed and the righteous who are saved is whether or not they seek God (Psalm 9:10). 

While there is an overwhelming focus on the here and now in these psalms, there is also a glimpse into eternity. Those who forget God will go into the grave forever (Psalm 9:17). Those who seek God will not perish, but will be lifted up from the gates of death (Psalm 9:13, 18).

Where is the Gospel? 

Our world looks a lot like the world of psalms 9-10. Many believe there is no God and no judge. Others wonder why God seems to stand far away (Psalm 10:1). 

Psalm 9-10 tells us that there is a God, he is a judge, and he will not always seem far away. And we see that most clearly in Jesus. 

Jesus is the righteous King who is God, and who came to judge and be near us. Jesus is God in the flesh (John 1:14). He was appointed by God to judge the world (John 5:22). And he spent his ministry going to the marginalized and oppressed (Luke 4:18). Jesus proved he is the God David prayed to, the God who rescues the suffering righteous and comes to judge the arrogant wicked. 

Jesus taught the day of God's ultimate judgment is coming (Psalm 9:19). Jesus will bring all nations before his throne (Matthew 25:31). And Jesus himself will judge everyone who has ever lived according to what they have done (2 Corinthians 5:10). 

The Good News for us is that we don't deny this day is coming, like the wicked (Psalm 10:13). Instead, like David, we are saved by our hope in the coming day of judgment (Romans 8:24). We seek after that day like the righteous seek after God because it will not be the day we perish; it is the day we receive everlasting life (John 3:16). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who never forgets the oppressed and always brings down the wicked. And may you see Jesus as the coming judge who will come near to the righteous, remember the needy, and give hope to the oppressed."

In the last chapters of Esther we should feel both relieved and unsettled. God’s people in Persia are about to be saved through a series of dramatic reversals, but several details in the story are concerning.

Haman is dead, but his edict calling for the extermination of the Jews remains in effect (Esther 8:2). Queen Esther asks the king to reverse the edict, and Xerxes gives Esther and Mordecai the power to do so (Esther 8:8). They write a word-for-word reversal of Haman’s edict, allowing Jews to defend and avenge themselves against their enemies on the 13th day of Adar (Esther 8:11, 13). But Mordecai, instead of showing solidarity with his people, walks out of Xerxes’ palace dressed like a Persian king (Esther 8:15). But then as news of Haman and Mordecai’s reversal spreads, Persians throughout Xerxes’ empire become Jews and show solidarity by worshiping the God of Israel (Esther 8:17).

And when the 13th of Adar arrives, the enemies who hoped to destroy the Jews are themselves destroyed (Esther 9:1). While Mordecai's edict allowed it, we’re told the Jews took no plunder. This isn’t a war of revenge but a war that reverses the sin of Israel’s first king, Saul. In direct contradiction to God’s commands, Saul spared the forefather of Haman’s sons and plundered his land (1 Samuel 15:9). As the Jews rise to power in Persia, they’re careful not to repeat the same sins of Saul’s kingdom. But it’s worth noting that God has not approved or commanded this newest war.

Additionally, Esther asks for an extra day of vengeance in the Persian capital and for the dead bodies of Haman’s sons to be publicly displayed—impaled on trees—next to their father (Esther 9:13). Mordecai then formalizes this celebration with a feast just like the Persian feasts that began Esther’s story (Esther 9:20-21). The feast is called 

Purim

 after the lots Haman used; they are no longer objects of death, but life and victory (Esther 9:26)! But like the unsanctioned war, Purim is the only Jewish feast in Scripture not directly established by God. Soberingly, the book ends with Xerxes still on his throne (Esther 10:1-2) and Mordecai elevated to the seat of power that Haman used to plot the Jew’s destruction (Esther 10:3).

Where is the Gospel?

Esther and Mordecai are heroes, but their actions are often unsettling. Esther hides her Jewishness and abandons Jewish laws (Esther 2:10). Both dress in the trappings of the Persian empire and have names derived from Persian gods (Esther 2:9, Esther 8:15). No moral dilemma crosses their minds as Esther enters the king’s bedroom to “please” him (Esther 2:15-16). Esther calls for the bodies of Haman’s sons to be publicly shamed after a day of unprovoked vengeance. And Mordecai, acting like only God has so far in Scripture, establishes a feast for the whole kingdom. Adding to all this moral ambiguity is that as our heroes act like Persians, Persians start worshiping like Jews.

Heartbreakingly, the world of Esther is a world we recognize—a world where God seems silent, and a world where those who have the power to act on God’s behalf often act like the rulers who oppress them. We belong to a world where the churches that lead people to start acting like Jesus are the same churches that act like the abusive Xerxes.

But the best news offered by a morally ambiguous book like Esther is that God is not limited in his power to do good and to save, even when all the people do wrong. And Jesus’ death proves the same point. Before Jesus died, the leadership of Israel wanted him dead. The elites of Rome were cowards. The mob was hungry for blood. And for all the good deeds and miracles Jesus’ disciples had both seen and performed themselves, they all either betrayed, denied, or abandoned him. But just like the events of Esther, God’s power was not limited by the actions of these men and women (Acts 2:23). Instead, evil, chaos, and moral ambiguity provided the stage for resurrection and the proof that God can reverse death into an eternity of victory and life.

See For Yourself

Esther has just been crowned Xerxes’ queen. But immediately Mordecai, Esther’s guardian and cousin, discovers a conspiracy among the king’s eunuchs to assassinate Xerxes (Esther 2:21). Together, they inform the king who quickly executes the would-be assassins (Esther 2:23). But instead of rewarding Mordecai for his loyalty, Xerxes promotes Haman, a descendant of King Agag (Esther 3:1). That genealogy is significant because we’re previously told Mordecai is a descendent of Israel’s first king, Saul (Esther 2:5). It was Saul’s failure to destroy Agag that cost Saul his throne (1 Samuel 15:9-11). Since that time the Agagites were the ancestral enemies of the descendants of King Saul.

Xerxes then demands all of his officials bow down to Haman, but Mordecai refuses (Esther 3:2). The other officials question Mordecai’s motive in disobeying the king’s order (Esther 3:3). But it’s clear that Mordecai will not repeat the sins of his ancestors. When Haman is informed of Mordecai’s insubordination, he’s enraged (Esther 3:5). But when he hears of Mordecai’s lineage, he becomes genocidal (Esther 3:6). He will end the feud his ancestors started.

Haman casts a kind of dice called “pur” to determine the best date for his vendetta (Esther 3:7). Once determined, Haman goes to Xerxes and requests the murder of all Jews under the guise of protecting the king’s financial interests (Esther 3:8). And Xerxes agrees to this day of death.Persians are encouraged to kill all their Jewish neighbors and take whatever plunder they desire (Esther 3:13). But neither realize this decree will kill Esther, Xerxes’ queen.

Mordecai informs Esther about Haman’s plot and begs her to go before the king and plead their people’s case (Esther 4:8). But Esther knows this is practically a death sentence (Esther 4:11). Mordecai warns that she might die anyway. It’s better to throw herself on the mercy of Xerxes than into the hands of a genocidal mob (Esther 4:13). If Esther doesn’t act, Mordecai is confident that rescue for the Jews will come from somewhere else. But he also wonders if Esther has been made queen precisely for this moment (Esther 4:14). Convinced that she must act (or at least convinced she’s out of options), Esther tells Mordecai that she will go to the king—and if she dies, she dies (Esther 4:16).

Where is the Gospel?

The conflict between Mordecai and Haman doesn’t just stretch back to King Saul and King Agag, but to the first pages of the Bible. God promised that the Serpent’s offspring would be in constant conflict with the children of Eve until the day of death when the Serpent’s head would be crushed under the heel of Eve’s son (Genesis 3:15). Mordecai and Haman are new descendants caught in this ancient conflict. But this time, the roles seem to be reversed. Haman’s boot hovers heavy over the head of Eve’s son, Mordecai. So the question is, will God be faithful to provide that promised day of death against the Serpent? Or are Eve’s children just choosing between two ways to die?

God is never mentioned in Esther. Neither are the promises he makes with his people. However, Mordecai seems to have faith in this promised day of death. He’s convinced that salvation for the offspring of Eve will arise, if not in Esther, then from somewhere else (Esther 4:14). And in the moment Mordecai encourages Esther to become the promised Snake-Crusher, he’s also prophesying the ultimate rescue of God’s people in Jesus.

Like Esther, Jesus risks his life in the hands of a king, knowing that he might die (John 18:29-30). But unlike Esther, Jesus dies. A day of death does come, even for Jesus. But Jesus rose from the grave, demolishing the Serpent and his powers (Colossians 2:15). And by his resurrection he finally crushes the head of the Serpent, the ancestral enemy of God’s people. In Esther, God’s purposes would be completed in Persia. But in Jesus, God’s promises come true fully and finally.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has planned the destruction of our enemies. And may you see Jesus as the one who crushed the head of our enemy when his heel was struck on the cross."

",Website,Esther Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

To approach the king unsummoned is a death sentence, and Queen Esther has just placed her life in the king’s hands (Esther 5:1). Both she and the Jewish people will be massacred unless the king shows mercy and gives Esther a chance to reverse the genocidal decree written by Haman. But contrary to her fears, Esther does not die. The king instead offers Esther up to half his kingdom (Esther 5:3). It’s the first of several ironies—reversal after reversal of what’s expected.

The next reversal is that Esther asks for a feast with the king and Haman instead of asking for her people’s lives (Esther 5:4). Esther pours wine for her king and Haman and invites the drunken pair to dinner again the next day (Esther 5:8). When Haman leaves the party, he sees Mordecai, who still refuses to bow to his authority (Esther 5:9). Haman restrains his anger momentarily and arrives home. He forgets Mordecai as he brags to his friends and family about his good fortune, his power, and his invitations to the queen’s feast (Esther 5:11). But his anger leaks out and his wife suggests Haman execute Mordecai by impaling him on a stake 75 feet in the air (Esther 5:14). It’s an enormous pole to match Haman’s inflated ego, so naturally this plan pleases him. But yet another reversal is brewing.

Xerxes can’t sleep and asks for his royal records to be read to him (Esther 6:1). As the scroll is read, Xerxes realizes that Mordecai had once saved his life and was never properly celebrated (Esther 6:3). Haman storms into the room, ready to murder Mordecai while Xerxes is ready to celebrate him. Xerxes asks Haman how he should honor a man the king delights in (Esther 6:6). Haman, knowing no one as great as himself, gushes about every honor and celebration he could desire (Esther 6:8-9). Thrilled with Haman’s plans, Xerxes tells him to fulfill all of his wildest dreams and celebrate Mordecai, the man he plans to kill (Esther 6:10). Ironically,Haman’s name means “celebrated one.” And in this moment the celebrity Haman is forced to celebrate the one man who refused to celebrate him. Haman’s name has been humiliated and Haman’s wife understands this as a foreshadowing of what's to come. The woman who inspired Haman to kill Mordecai on a pole now predicts that Haman will be impaled on his own stick (Esther 6:13).

Immediately, Haman is called to another banquet (Esther 6:14). But Esther reveals, for the first time, that she is a Jew, which means Haman has conspired to kill Xerxes’ queen (Esther 7:6). Haman begs for his life, but Xerxes mistakes Haman’s begging as an assault. He demands Haman’s immediate execution on the stake built for Mordecai (Esther 7:7-10).

Where is the Gospel?

God is never mentioned in Xerxes’ pagan kingdom. Instead, we’re given justice so poetic it would be irresponsible to conclude there was no divine poet. In the moment the “celebrated one” thought he would be honored, he’s forced to celebrate his enemy; the feast Haman thought communicated his elevated status was his downfall; the moment of his begging was judged as assault, and the pole he thought would vindicate his damaged honor was the public shaming of his name. God is an ironic historian, and he authors history so that evil plotted always rhymes with evil punished.

But the greatest plot against God’s people was not Haman in Persia; It was Satan against Jesus. Like Haman, Satan pulled all the levers of the Empire to massacre his enemy (Matthew 27:1-2). And like Haman he erects beams of wood to impale Jesus. But unlike the divine author of Esther who ironically undoes Haman’s evil before it happens, Jesus dies (Matthew 27:50). But just as Esther had a secret that undid Haman’s plan, there was a secret hidden in Jesus’ death too (1 Corinthians 2:6-7). If Satan and his rulers had known this secret, they would have never crucified Jesus (1 Corinthians 2:8). And just as Mordecai rose in power over Haman, Jesus rose in power over death itself.

There are no politics too godless and there is no grave too dark that God cannot reverse for his people. Ironically, while God might be unseen, unheard, and unthought of in Esther or our own lives, that doesn’t mean God is not plotting resurrection and victory for those who trust him (1 Corinthians 2:9).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the hidden Author of history. And may you see Jesus and his cross as the ultimate ironic victory over our enemies' schemes."

The book of Esther never mentions the name of God. Instead, it describes a king who seems to have taken God’s place. Xerxes, the king of Persia, throws a massive feast for all his governors, politicians, and servants (Esther 1:3). It’s a declaration of Xerxes' unparalleled power, glory, and wealth (Esther 1:4). For 187 days the leaders of Persia feast and drink with their king (Esther 1:5). Xerxes is god-like in his generosity and abundance. Even Xerxes’ palace seems divine. In fact, the only place in Scripture that rivals the opulence, beauty, and color of Xerxes’ palace is God’s temple (Esther 1:6; 1 Kings 6:21).

As final proof of his preeminence, Xerxes calls his queen, Vashti, to parade her beauty before the gathered princes of his empire (Esther 1:11). But she refuses to play her role in her husband’s pompous theater (Esther 1:12). Enraged that his sovereignty has been publicly contradicted, Xerxes calls his wise men to solve the problem (Esther 1:13). They claim that the wives of Xerxes’ officials will convince their husbands to undermine Xerxes’ authority, just like Vashti (Esther 1:18). For all his god-like power, Xerxes’ authority is fragile and undermined by just one woman. Xerxes follows his wise men’s advice, banishes Vashti, and determines to replace her with someone more pliable (Esther 1:20).

The young men of his court suggest a pageant to determine the new queen (Esther 2:2, 4). Unlike Vashti, the virgins of the kingdom would parade their beauty before the king, and then Xerxes would demonstrate his god-like dominance over them one by one; whichever woman “pleased” him most would become the new queen. Xerxes loves this idea.

But one of the women swept up into Xerxes’ plan is a Jewish virgin, Esther (Esther 2:5, 7). Like the priests of Israel prepared themselves to enter God’s temple, Esther prepares to enter Xerxes’ bedroom (Esther 2:12, Leviticus 8:12-13). But when Xerxes finally calls her to prove his dominance, she is crowned queen of Persia (Esther 2:17). Xerxes throws another feast and once again the entire empire experiences the god-like generosity of their king (Esther 2:18).

Where is the Gospel?

God is never mentioned in the book of Esther. In his place, we’re given a self-contradicting deity in Xerxes. He’s omnibenevolent, but raging. A sovereign leader whose decrees are final, but only when written by others after drinks. And an emperor whose power is absolutely fragile in the hands of the women he thought he could use. Soon enough, Esther will even reverse one of Xerxes’ “irreversible” decrees (Esther 8:8). Xerxes’ divinity is so comically ironic that we’re forced to ask if the invisible God of the Jews is writing these jokes.

God’s invisible pen often appoints unlikely women to undo the carnage of evil empires (Joshua 2:1; Judges 4:21; 1 Samuel 1:10-11). Vashti and Esther are God’s newest punchlines against the fragility of empires like Persia. Even our salvation in Jesus from the ultimate empires of Sin and Death begins with God’s choice of another Jewish virgin named Mary (Luke 1:32-34). Like Vashti and Esther, she is a harbinger of the fragility of empires. Mary even sings that her pregnancy means the end of the world order as it stood (Luke 1:52). And an angel declared Mary’s child would rule as King forever.

Mary’s child is Jesus. Unlike Xerxes, Jesus is not a king pretending to be all-powerful; he is God taking on the powerlessness of humanity (Philippians 2:6-7). And as Esther was taken to the bedroom of an emperor, Jesus was stripped naked and laid in a tomb as the Emperors of this world exerted their dominance (Matthew 27:35). But just as Esther rose from her bed and was crowned Queen, Jesus rose from the dead and was crowned as the true and only all-powerful sovereign King. Unlike Xerxes, Jesus does not use his power to dominate the vulnerable, but establishes a Kingdom of consistent and unironic good for his people. The unnamed God of Esther rules forever. And even now, in a world where it seems like he might be missing, God is still writing jokes and choosing the small and insignificant to undo the god-like and the proud.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who often seems unseen. And may you see Jesus as the Son of Mary who has come to topple the empires of the world.

And Jesus proves that true. He died while we were still sinners.",Website,Job Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The book of Job wants to teach us wisdom—particularly, how to think wisely about God, especially when we suffer. The book introduces us to an innocent, moral, and upright man named Job (Job 1:1). He has a large family and a massive amount of wealth (Job 1:2-3). Job is careful not only to obey God, but also continually sacrifice for the potential sins of his children (Job 1:5).

Then we are introduced to a heavenly council meeting and a character called the Accuser (Job 1:6). God praises Job’s innocence and integrity (Job 1:8). But the Accuser suggests Job is being moral only because he’s after God’s rewards (Job 1:10). 

The Accuser accuses God of mismanaging his universe. He believes God’s policy of rewarding good behavior means that Job’s morality is purely transactional. The only reason Job obeys is to get God’s stuff (Job 1:9-10). While rewarding good people and punishing bad people might get God external and ritual obedience, it won’t cause Job to bless or love God. In fact, if God takes away his rewards, the Accuser fully expects Job to curse God (Job 1:11). 

God allows the Accuser to put him and his management of the universe on trial. If an innocent Job suffers and curses God, the Accuser wins and God’s policies are proven to be flawed.

So God sends the Accuser to take away everything good Job had been given (Job 1:12). God grants permission to cover Job in open sores (Job 2:7). But despite the Accuser’s predictions, Job refuses to curse God (Job 1:21). Instead, Job blesses him and recognizes that integrity and innocence don’t always guarantee blessing (Job 2:10). 

But the trial of God’s management of the universe has just begun.

Where is the Gospel?

It’s easy for us to believe that God works through some type of transactional system. Suffering is caused because of our sin; health and wealth are connected to our morality. You even hear this thinking when TV personalities try to explain things like wildfires and hurricanes as the result of some law passed by a nation.

Thinking of God transactionally makes us feel perpetually worried. We’ll always be concerned God is just waiting to punish us for some sin, some infraction, or some mistake. We will always be suspicious that our suffering is really God’s way of getting back at us. So we’ll either beat ourselves up to prove God doesn’t need to punish us, or we will resent God for being so nitpicky. This is exactly the dynamic the Accuser claims God has instituted in the world and will cause Job to curse God (Job 1:11). 

But God is not transactional. As Job says, God is good both when he gives and takes away (Job 1:20). Blessing and suffering don’t operate according to strict equations but divine wisdom. The whole book of Job will explore this idea, but Jesus proves it’s true.

God blesses us while we were still sinners. Jesus died for our sins when our bad deeds outweigh our good (Romans 5:8). Jesus did not demand what he was transactionally owed by his title as God’s Son with his perfect life and sacrificial death. Instead, he gave it up (Philipians 2:7). And through his death, everything that belongs to God now belongs to us (2 Corinthians 5:21; John 16:15).

God does not rule his universe according to strict transactions. He rules with lavish, loving, and self-giving wisdom. Like Job, we don’t need to resent or curse God. We can bless the one who took away our sin, gave himself to us, and doesn’t give us what we deserve. 

This is the first step in thinking wisely about God, especially when we suffer.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who gives and takes away. And may you see Jesus as God, whose life was taken so that we may be given what we do not deserve."

It invites us to trust that God takes pride in us, even when we're foolish.",Website,Job Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

After God’s speech, Job is humbled. He admits that his accusations against God were made without enough knowledge or understanding (Job 42:3). Job is ashamed of the way he blamed God and repents (Job 42:6).

God then turns to Job’s friends and rebukes them for their more serious misrepresentation of God (Job 42:7). Their misunderstanding of how God related to Job, and to suffering in general, was so egregious it demanded a sacrifice (Job 42:8). God then restores everything Job had lost. He even doubles it (Job 42:10).

It’s difficult to understand why exactly God restores Job’s prosperity. The whole book has been arguing that God doesn’t operate according to a strict cause-and-effect system of justice. To reward Job for his repentance seems counterproductive, not to mention that restored wealth doesn’t erase suffering. Job’s new children don’t replace or heal his grief over the children he lost (Job 42:12-13). 

Remember that the book of Job isn’t about explaining why Job suffered; it’s about God and how he rules his universe. The Accuser said God is wrong to reward the righteous (Job 1:9). Job said God is wrong to let the innocent suffer (Job 40:8). The friends insist that God operates according to their ideas of justice (Job 4:7).

And the book of Job has proven them all wrong. 

Rewarding good behavior doesn’t necessarily mean we will have bad motives. Judging God’s character based on our limited knowledge or power is inappropriate. And binding God to our understanding of justice in order to blame others for their suffering is foolish.

This allows us to see Job’s restored wealth for what it’s meant to be—a gift. Job does not deserve prosperity. God is not obligated to double his fortune. Job’s fortunes were never God’s mechanistic response to his obedience, but rather evidence of God’s pleasure in blessing a man he takes pride in. 

Where is the Gospel?

God rules his universe well. He rules it according to both wisdom and love, even when we don’t understand how that’s possible. Suffering is a threat to God’s wisdom and love only when we think we’re smarter than God and believe our understanding of moral cause and effect is better informed than God’s infinite knowledge. The book of Job invites us to lay down our pride and humble ourselves before God’s wisdom and love. 

The book of Job invites us to trust that God takes pride in us, even when we’re foolish. And to trust that God loves to give good gifts to his children (Matthew 7:11).

Yes, God loves obedience to his rules and laws. But our obedience is not the prerequisite of his love. God is love even when we suffer (1 John 4:8). And God’s greatest gift was his Son. Jesus was sent not because we deserve it, but because he loves us even when we’re misrepresenting him—like Job and his friends did (John 3:16). 

It’s good news that God doesn’t manage his universe according to our concepts of justice. It’s good news that God doesn’t govern according to the principle: “I will help those who help themselves.” And it’s good news to know that even when our suffering makes it look like God is against us, God is always for us (Romans 8:31).

The Apostle Paul says that in Jesus’ wisdom and grace, our wealth isn’t merely doubled. We are blessed with every spiritual blessing (Ephesians 1:3). And that blessing doesn’t come because we deserve it, but because we trust that even in our suffering, God is loving, gracious, and wise (Ephesians 1:7-8). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who rules his universe according to wisdom and love. And may you see Jesus as the one who does not treat us according to our standards of justice, but with undeserved love."

Job has sat in silence for seven days surrounded by his friends. When he finally speaks, he doesn’t curse God like the Accuser from chapter one predicted. Instead, he curses the day he was born (Job 3:1). The fact that Job understands God can both give and take away doesn’t diminish the painfulness of his suffering (Job 1:21). So Job wails and wishes he had never been born (Job 3:4).

Job’s lament deepens even further. Job believes death would be a sweet relief from his brutal suffering (Job 3:13). If he was doomed to be born, he wishes he would have died in childbirth (Job 3:16). Job wonders why God extends his life if all that’s left is misery (Job 3:20). He even says the hedge that God used to protect him has become like a prison of misery (Job 1:10, 3:23). This veiled accusation against God causes Job’s friend Eliphaz to speak. 

Eliphaz believes that God doesn’t allow the innocent to suffer (Job 4:7). He believes suffering is only caused by someone’s sin (Job 4:8). Compared to God’s purity, everyone is guilty (Job 4:17). So Eliphaz accuses Job of dishonesty. He must have done something wrong. If Job would just admit it, God would restore everything he had lost (Job 5:19).

Job is insulted (Job 6:15). He doesn’t want a lecture about God rewarding good people and punishing bad people. Job wants an explanation for his own suffering and demands his friends produce specific examples (Job 6:24). Job isn’t interested in admitting to wrongs he didn’t commit. And he doesn’t want everything to go back to normal. Job wants his name cleared (Job 6:28-29). Job wants both his friends and God to know he has done nothing wrong.

Where is the Gospel?

Whenever the innocent suffer, there are always people who offer quick explanations. They say things like “he deserved it” and “serves him right.” Jesus’ disciples thought the same way about suffering when they saw a blind man (John 9:2).

But both Job and Jesus reject this as an explanation for all our suffering (John 9:3a). Remember, the book of Job puts our ideas about good and bad, reward and suffering on trial. And this book inches toward the verdict that a version of karma does not run the universe—God does. 

And God does not believe that everyone who suffers deserves it. God knows the victim can’t always be blamed. Eliphaz is wrong. Job is right. There is such a thing as truly innocent suffering, and God will prove it. In Jesus, God came and innocently suffered for us (Hebrews 4:15). This was not simply to prove that innocent suffering exists as a philosophical idea, but to clear our names when people blame us for our suffering. 

Remember, Jesus’ name was dragged through the mud. He was a victim falsely blamed (Mark 14:64). On the cross, Jesus becomes the curses we’ve heard about us (Galatians 3:13). At his death, any suffering our friends, family, Satan, and our minds blame us for is nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:14). Jesus disarms weaponized philosophies that blame the victim, and shames them for the shame they cause (Colossians 2:15).

In Jesus, Job’s hope for a cleared name is secured. When we trust Jesus' innocent death, our shame is taken away. And when we hope in Jesus' resurrection, our blame is cancelled (Romans 8:34). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who innocently suffers. And may you see Jesus as the one who doesn’t blame us for our innocent suffering, but dies to end our shame."

So far, both of Job’s friends assume Job is not as sinless as he claims (Job 11:3-4). Zophar, Job’s third friend, goes even further and says Job is not suffering as much as he deserves (Job 11:6). He invites Job to imagine what it would look like for God to punish all of his sins! But like Job’s other friends, Zophar holds out hope for restoration. If Job stops his hidden sins, God will give back everything that he lost (Job 11:14-15).

Job’s friends want Job to repent and clean up his act so he can get his good life back. But Job is only interested in maintaining his innocence (Job 14:16). More importantly, Job wants his relationship with God to be restored. Just listen to Job’s cry: “You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made” (Job 14:15).

This doesn’t mean Job is perfect in how he presents that request. Job presumptuously claims to know God’s motives (Job 9:13). He frequently implies God is overly critical (Job 13:25-26). Job rightly rejects his friends’ simplistic understanding of God’s rewards and punishment (Job 13:7). But he wrongly accuses God as part of the problem (Job 13:25). 

Remember, the book of Job wasn’t written primarily to show us an example of someone who suffers well. It was written to help us think rightly about God, especially when we suffer. 

As the first set of speeches ends, we’re asked to evaluate both Job’s and his friends' views about God and suffering. Job’s friends believe all suffering is deserved. But Job knows he’s innocent. So instead of blaming himself, Job begins to question God’s fairness. He accuses God of slowly eroding all his hope (Job 14:19).

Where is the Gospel?

A major difference between Job and his friends is what they hope for. Zophar, along with the others, hopes that everything Job lost will be returned to him. But Job hopes for his relationship with God to be renewed (Job 14:14). 

Job wants to speak to God; he longs for God to desire to be in relationship with him (Job 14:15). If that type of relationship can exist again, Job’s confident that his innocence will be upheld and any sin will be covered and forgotten (Job 14:16-17).

That type of relationship with God is available in Jesus. We are Jesus’ beloved and he desires us, just like Job hoped (Song of Songs 7:10). The Apostle Paul compares Jesus’ desire for us to the love a husband has for his wife. And out of Jesus’ great love, he dies so that his beloved will be innocent of all faults (Ephesians 5:25-26).

In Jesus, Job’s hopes for relationship are met and exceeded. Not only does Jesus restore our relationship with God and call us innocent, we become intimately one with God as his Holy Spirit lives in us (John 17:21). Just as Job insisted against the accusations of Zophar, the Holy Spirit insists that our suffering can’t be a punishment for our sin because that punishment has been nailed to the cross. We are now and will always be innocent (Romans 8:1). 

Despite what our suffering seems to insinuate, God is not tormenting us. And when our suffering makes that hard to believe, the Holy Spirit will remind us that our cries are heard by a God who is a loving Father and not an unfair judge (Romans 8:14-16).

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who desires a relationship with us. And may you see Jesus as the one who fills us with his Holy Spirit so that we will always know, even when we suffer, that God is still with us."

Job’s friends are growing increasingly frustrated with Job. So they spend most of their time implicating Job in the fates of wicked people. Bildad describes the consequences of rejecting God in ways that mirror Job’s own suffering (Job 18:19). He then writes Job off for not knowing God (Job 18:21). Zophar does the same and says Job’s sufferings prove that God is angry at him (Job 20:28). 

But Job does know God. And we know that God is not angry with him (Job 1:8). Job’s friends are drawing illegitimate conclusions about Job because they take a piece of biblical truth too far. The book of Proverbs talks extensively about the way God rewards the upright and punishes the wicked (Proverbs 11:21). And as a description of God’s justice, that’s true. But the Bible never takes the leap that Bildad, Eliphaz, and Zophar do with Job. The Bible never says that everyone who suffers is wicked. The Bible never says that health and wealth are irrefutable signs of good behavior. 

This is why Job spends all of chapter 21 detailing the ways the wicked—and not the upright—prosper. Bad people constantly live free from fear, surrounded by wealth (Job 21:9, 13). Job points out that his friends’ ideas about God and justice are broken. Their worldview doesn’t allow for the real and self-evident categories of innocent suffering and evil prosperity.

But this doesn’t mean Job understands God and suffering. Job compares God to a merciless predator (Job 16:13). He accuses God of lashing out in anger at him (Job 19:11). He also insinuates that God fails to judge evil (Job 21:30-31). 

As Job intensifies his language against God, so do his cries for someone to represent him before God. Job wants someone to prove that it’s possible to be both innocent and still suffer. Job firmly believes a redeemer, or an advocate, will stand with him in his suffering, represent his case before God, and help him understand why all this has happened to him (Job 19:25-26). 

Where is the Gospel?

Some of us suffer all of the time, and all of us suffer some of the time. 

And when we suffer, it’s easy to absorb the non-biblical idea that all suffering is due to sin, and all success is due to our obedience. That makes it even easier to blame ourselves. We believe, like Job’s friends kept insisting, that we’re the reason for our suffering. 

That logic makes a cruel kind of sense. It makes sense to blame our poverty on our laziness. Or to think God is finally getting back at us for all the stupid things we did as teenagers (Job 13:26). It’s easy for those of us who are chronically ill to ask: “What did I do to deserve this?” It’s easy to wonder, as you watch other people get ahead faster than you, that God must love them more than you. 

When our minds, our world, and our friends blame us for our innocent suffering, we need an advocate to remind us of our innocence. We need a redeemer to salvage our reputation, even if it’s just from a voice in our head. And that Redeemer is Jesus. 

Jesus calls us innocent when we trust in him (Romans 3:22). Jesus does battle against every thought and friend who uses our suffering against us to prove their theological point (Romans 8:31). If God gave up his own Son to include us in his family, how will he not also give us everything needed to salvage our reputation from our accusers (Romans 8:32)? No accusation of blame can stand and no suffering is proof that we are separated from the love of Jesus (Romans 8:35).

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who rewards the upright and punishes the wicked. And may you see Jesus as the Redeemer who lives and gives us our day in court."

Job and his friends have been wrestling with how God and the world work. They’re looking for a coherent way to understand God’s justice, our suffering, and our innocence. In short, they’re looking for wisdom. They’re looking for a reasonable answer to why the world is the way it is. That quest for wisdom is made explicit with a song about the source of wisdom.

In Job’s day, human technology allowed people to plunge deep into the heart of the earth and pull up precious gems (Job 28:6). The act of mining represents for Job the farthest frontier of human ingenuity and possibility. And in particular, mining brings hidden things to light (Job 28:11). 

But for all the mines humans have dug, wisdom has never been excavated (Job 28:12-13). Job imagines the depths of the earth, knowing wisdom can’t be mined (Job 28:14). The ocean floor tells us to look somewhere else (Job 28:14). And for all that money can do, it can’t buy wisdom (Job 28:15). On the earth, wisdom is perpetually elusive (Job 28:20). 

But God knows where wisdom is hidden (Job 28:23). He sees the whole earth—and not just from a high vantage point (Job 28:24). God sees the earth as its Creator and Founder. He determined the weight of wind and established laws and forces governing raindrops and lightning bolts (Job 28:25-26). God knows the way the world works and understands the coherent way all the parts of his universe fit together (Job 28:27). 

The song ends by telling us that if we want to know wisdom, we must obey, trust, and fear God (Job 28:28). 

Where is the Gospel?

Chapter 28 marks a turning point in the book of Job. The Accuser has been proved wrong, but Job’s challenge remains unanswered—namely, that it’s bad policy for the righteous to suffer because it undermines God’s justice. This wisdom song’s placement at the end of Job’s arguments makes it clear wisdom has not been heard yet. 

But more importantly this song signals that the answer to how the world works is not found in God’s justice, but in God’s wisdom. Rigid heavenly policies will not answer Job’s questions about justice, innocence, and suffering. But God’s wisdom will.

The book of Job will continue to develop wisdom’s answer to our suffering, but for now we can rejoice that the wisdom the greatest acts of human ingenuity cannot find, is found in Jesus (Colossians 2:3). 

Since a coherent answer to our suffering can’t be found on or under the earth, God’s wisdom descends to the earth in the person of Jesus. In him we begin to understand how innocence, suffering, and justice come together. The Apostle Paul says the cross, where Jesus suffers as an innocent man for the justice we deserve, is actually the epitome of God’s wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:23-24). In other words, the world works by the wisdom of Jesus. The coherent answers to our questions about why we suffer, who gets rewarded, and why some are punished are found in trusting Jesus’ willingness to suffer for sins not his fault, and give us rewards we don’t deserve. 

This isn’t the clear answer we normally want for why we suffer. But it should be enough to trust that God isn’t out to get us. God’s world is run by a strange wisdom that allows guilty people to be forgiven and rewarded, based on the innocent suffering of the person who created the world.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who rules the world with wisdom. And may you see Jesus as God’s wisdom in the flesh. "
spokengospel_Job 32-37_text,Job 32-37,Young and Angry Elihu,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ec12d1cd984b7ed1155746/6402933e4b57269e986b4bf4_book-hero-ph.webp,https://www.spokengospel.com/devotionals/job-32-37#read,,"In Job 32-27, we see that when it comes to suffering, explanations are insufficient, blaming God is a dead end, and more than anything, innocent sufferers need God to speak to them in their pain. And God does more than speak, he comes.",Website,Job Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Out of nowhere, Elihu, an angry young man, speaks up (Job 32:2a). He’s been waiting for the older men to have their say before offering his opinion (Job 32:4). He’s angry because Job is more interested in defending his own innocence than defending God’s character (Job 32:2b). He accuses Job of self-righteousness at the expense of God’s justice. God will eventually say the same thing about Job (Job 40:8).

Elihu is also angry at Job’s friends because they’ve condemned Job as guilty without evidence and failed to meet Job’s challenges (Job 32:5). In response to Job, Elihu offers a defense of God’s justice (Job 26:3). And in response to Job’s friends, Elihu offers a different explanation for Job’s sufferings. 

Job is not suffering for something he has done, but for his attitude of self-righteousness (Job 34:37). Job’s suffering isn’t punishment so much as discipline. Elihu defends God’s justice by explaining that suffering is God’s way of teaching Job humility (Job 36:15). Suffering isn’t God responding to past sins, but preventing future ones. 

Job defends his innocence, and his friends defend their understanding of moral cause and effect. Yet Elihu is the only character in the book of Job who attempts to defend God’s justice in light of Job’s innocent suffering. 

And Elihu is right to do so. God is not accountable to us (Job 37:23-24). God’s justice cannot be questioned (Job 36:30-31). We can’t do his job better or evaluate his actions (Job 26:23). Elihu is right about God’s character and power, but his attempt to solve the puzzle of innocent suffering and God’s justice is just as inadequate as Job’s other friends. 

The explanation that suffering is a tool to encourage humility and prevent future evil doesn’t fit every circumstance. Think of children who die in the womb. Elihu’s speech reveals that all human explanations are ultimately deficient. God is the only one who can explain why the innocent suffer.

Where is the Gospel?

We are on the verge of God finally responding to Job’s requests for an audience and an explanation for his suffering. While Elihu offers us the most nuanced picture of how God’s justice and human suffering might work, it’s incomplete. Again, we are nudged into trusting God’s wisdom and character more than our rationalizations or explanations of his actions.

While logical arguments defending God are useful, they ultimately fail to explain the complexity of God or dignify the depth of human pain. While accusing God of mishandling our lives can feel satisfying, it’s ultimately naive and prideful to assume our limited human knowledge can judge God’s decisions—or do better if given the chance. When it comes to suffering, explanations are insufficient. Blaming God is a dead end. More than anything, innocent sufferers need God to speak.

And God does more than speak; he comes. God’s answer to suffering is to become human in the person of Jesus. God doesn’t shout angry explanations from the heavens for his actions like Elihu. Jesus doesn’t accuse us of deserving our suffering like Job’s friends (John 9:2-3). Jesus doesn’t seek to prove his own innocence and end his suffering as Job does (2 Corinthians 5:21). 

Instead, God speaks gently to those who are suffering (Matthew 11:29). Jesus offers his own body as a defense of his love towards us. Jesus did not come to defend or enact his justice, but his mercy (John 3:17). When we trust that Jesus and his cross are God’s final word about our innocent suffering, and when we refuse to cling to our inadequate explanations or prideful blame, the cross always speaks comfort to those who are suffering. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who speaks. And may you see Jesus as God’s final word of comfort to those of us who are innocently suffering."

Job is fed up arguing with Eliphaz. He believes his suffering will eventually kill him (Job 7:6). So he speaks directly to God (Job 7:11). But the way he talks about God is concerning. Job accuses God of being too strict and exacting (Job 7:17-18). From Job’s perspective, God watches over him and punishes him without clear reasons (Job 7:20). Earlier in the book, God even acknowledges there are no reasons for his suffering (Job 2:3). 

But Job’s friend Bildad doesn’t like what Job is saying. God is always just and would never let the innocent suffer (Job 8:3). And since Job is suffering, he can't be as innocent as he claims (Job 8:6). Bildad implies that Job is guilty of rejecting God, which explains his suffering (Job 8:13). If Job is truly innocent, none of this would be happening (Job 8:20). 

But Job responds that it’s useless for a mortal to try to prove his innocence in God’s courtroom (Job 9:2). God is too powerful. No human can stand up to his questioning (Job 9:3-4). If God commands the earth and stars against his enemies, what hope does Job have of surviving God’s prosecution (Job 9:6-7)? Job even doubts that God will hear his case (Job 9:16). Mortals don’t get to summon deities. If God wanted, he could argue circles around Job and find a way to condemn him, even in his innocence (Job 9:28). The point is, Job is just a man. Mortals can’t argue with God and win (Job 9:32).

So Job hopes that an arbiter—an attorney—will come and allow him to approach God in his immortal power and make a case for his innocence (Job 9:33). 

Where is the Gospel?

Job is right to be afraid of bringing his case into God’s courtroom and hearing God’s arguments. Even if Job was the most brilliant attorney, God’s prosecution will always be more compelling. That’s why Job hopes for an arbiter to present the case of his innocent suffering before God. 

That arbiter is Jesus. Like Job, he innocently suffers. Like Job, he pleads for an explanation from God for his suffering (Matthew 27:46). But unlike Job, he has no reason to fear God’s courtroom or God’s verdicts. Jesus is not just a mortal man, he’s God himself. Jesus is the attorney who can give innocent Job his day in court.

And the Apostle John says that Jesus doesn’t only represent innocent clients, but guilty ones as well. “If anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the Righteous One” (1 John 2:1). Job feared entering the courtroom, but Jesus boldly argues that we are innocent.

And more than simply arguing our innocence, Jesus wipes away our sin through his death (1 John 2:2). Because of Jesus’ advocacy and his atonement, we don’t need to be afraid to stand in God’s courtroom. Like Jesus, we can boldly come before God’s throne and ask not just for innocence but anything we need (Hebrews 4:16).

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God as an immensely powerful Judge. And may you see Jesus as the one who not only advocates for our innocence, but makes us innocent by his cross."

Job offers his final defense to God. He begins by remembering the way his life was before he suffered. Job enjoyed a special relationship with God (Job 29:4-5). Job’s generosity met the needs of the poor and vulnerable (Job 29:12). Job hopes that his life will be a long, honorable one (Job 29:18). Job even compares himself to a brave king, ruling with justice (Job 29:24-25).

But everything has been stripped from Job. Every social honor has been replaced with shame. Lowlifes take advantage of and mock his ill fortune (Job 30:10, 13). Terror and darkness chase away his good name and harm him (Job 30:15, 17). In all this, God remains silent (Job 30:20). Job feels as if God has been cruel (Job 30:21); that he has joined forces with terror and darkness to make his life into a swirling chaotic storm (Job 30:22).

Job is done. He wants God to either affirm his innocence or kill him as a guilty man. So Job signs his name on an oath of innocence and presents it to God (Job 31:35). It’s a long list of everything he hasn’t done wrong.

He never seduced a woman (Job 31:9). He never lied (Job 31:5). He never abandoned justice (Job 31:13). He never failed to be generous to the poor (Job 31:16). He can’t be accused of greed (Job 31:24). Job is so confident of his innocence, he even details what his own punishments should be (Job 31:22). 

Job assumes that if God is paying attention and if Job has spoken lies, he will be killed for his false oath. But if God is paying attention and doesn’t respond, Job must be innocent; his suffering must be unfair. 

As readers, we already know Job is innocent from the first chapter (Job 1:9). So Job has contrived a scenario in which the only thing God can do is say nothing. But if God remains silent, Job’s accusation that God is unfair and even cruel for allowing Job to suffer is left unresolved. 

Where is the Gospel?

Like Job, we find it difficult, if not impossible, to make sense of our innocent suffering without questioning God’s character. And since we know suffering can’t always be blamed on the victim, it feels as if the only option left is to question God’s character. Our experiences of undeserved shame, chronic illness, unfair rejection, and innocent suffering seem like good evidence that God is cruel.

But soon, Job will be rebuked by God for this accusation (Job 40:8). God will tell Job that he simply doesn’t have enough knowledge or power to make that type of judgment—and neither do we (and we will talk about that soon).

But what we do have that Job did not, is God’s character displayed in Jesus.

Jesus’ life was marked by his compassion for the helpless (Matthew 9:36), his care for the chronically suffering (John 9:6; Mark 3:5), and his concern for the oppressed (Mark 5:15). Jesus-—God’s character in the flesh—is not cruel. 

More significantly, God, in Jesus, suffers innocently on the cross so the suffering of his people might end (Isaiah 53:4-5). God’s suffering in Jesus reveals that God is not cruel.

Keep in mind that God never tells Job why he suffered. That’s because the book of Job directs us to trust God more than it tries to satisfy our deep desire for answers. And while that’s frustrating, it’s also our good news. 

Our circumstances are not the measure of God’s love for us; Jesus is. 

No, we don’t know why we suffer. But we do know that God’s feelings toward us don’t change when our level of pain does. We never have to question God’s compassion toward us because that question has been permanently answered by Jesus’ cross.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who cares for the suffering. And may you see Jesus as a greater measure of God’s love for you than your suffering."

God finally speaks to Job in an angry storm (Job 38:1). Remember, Job put God on trial for mismanaging his universe. Job wants God to explain how his innocent suffering makes sense given his understanding of God’s justice and goodness. 

But instead of addressing his justice or explaining his actions, God asks Job a long list of rhetorical questions that reveal Job’s limited knowledge and power. 

At first, God interrogates Job as it relates to the cosmos. Job wasn’t there when the world was made (Job 38:4). Job can’t measure the sea (Job 38:11). He doesn’t know how to order a solar system (Job 38:19), much less design its constellations (Job 38:33). 

And then God interrogates Job’s lack of control over wild animals. Job can’t tame wild oxen (Job 39:9). He didn’t contribute to the power and speed of mustangs (Job 39:19). Job’s wisdom didn’t give hawks the ability to fly (Job 39:26). Job cannot compete with the knowledge and power of God on any scale (Job 40:2). So Job remains silent as God issues a challenge to him (Job 40:5-6).

He invites Job to act like God for a moment (Job 40:9-10). Job has accused him of injustice and managing his universe incorrectly (Job 40:8), so God tells him to do a better job; to enact justice the way he thinks it should be carried out (Job 40:12-13). If Job can build a cosmic system that operates according to his ideas of justice where the innocent never suffer, God is happy to admit Job is right and he is wrong (Job 40:14).

The point is, Job can’t build that system. Clearly Job doesn’t have enough information or power to blame God for organizing his world unfairly. 

Where is the Gospel?

Like Job, we believe our understanding of justice is enough to blame God when people innocently suffer. But that assumes we have an accurate picture of justice, and that justice is actually the best way to govern the universe.

In one of God’s questions to Job, he points out that he waters uninhabited land with rain (Job 38:26-27). But justice doesn’t apply to grasslands. Deserts can’t deserve rewards. It’s God’s way of saying that justice isn’t the most important virtue in governing the world—wisdom is.

True, a world ruled according to justice would have no innocent sufferers. But a world of perfect justice wouldn’t have room for mistakes either, much less the grace of rain on desert flowers.

Even a universe ruled by love and mercy would have problems. Truly evil people would prosper and probably take advantage of both the system and the innocent.

So that means we need a universe with both love and justice, mercy and suffering. But to God’s point, how would you choose who gets what? What laws and fundamental truths would govern? How would you build a universe where the innocent never suffer and the wicked never prosper?

The point is, you’re not wise enough. But God is. God is inviting us to humble ourselves and to admit we don’t know better than he does. And to admit that if we knew everything God does, we would build the world the way it is now.

And when we trust God’s wisdom, it frees us to realize the wisdom of Jesus’ cross. In Jesus both love and justice kiss (Psalm 85:10). 

Jesus dies as an innocent sufferer so that even those who don’t deserve it can be forgiven. In Job’s world of justice, Jesus’ self-sacrificial love would not be possible. In Job’s world of justice we would get only what we deserve. But when we trust God and his wise world where love and justice meet, we might unjustly suffer but we will always experience love we don’t deserve. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who governs with wisdom. And may you see Jesus as the one who innocently suffers so that we can experience undeserved love."

There are no chaotic monsters more powerful than him. Jesus proves that uncontrolled chaos can't be the reason why we suffer because God has chaos on a leash.",Website,Job Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

God continues to interrogate Job by calling him to study two creatures, Behemoth and Leviathan (Job 40:15; 41:1). 

Most likely these are references to the mythological chaos creatures of Job’s ancient world. These powerful creatures supposedly roamed the earth and caused death and suffering. But in God’s final speech, he shows that these chaotic forces are under his control. He uses them as illustrations of how Job should act towards a God like him. 

Job is like the chaos monster, Behemoth. Behemoth and Job are both God’s creatures (Job 40:15). Behemoth is preeminent among his kind, just as Job is the most successful among his (Job 40:19). Behemoth is protected by lotus trees like Job was protected by God’s hedge (Job 40:21; 1:10). 

Behemoth’s strength and preeminent position mean that he’s untroubled by turbulent waters and confident in the middle of adversity. This should be Job’s attitude as well (Job 40:23). God has given Job strength, power, and preeminence. Even though Job now experiences turbulence, he should trust the God who made him and also controls the chaos monster called Behemoth.

Besides, God is like a different mythological creature—Leviathan. Leviathan is untamable (Job 41:1-2) and submits to no one (Job 41:4). Leviathan cannot be wounded. Leviathan is unequaled on the earth (Job 41:7, 33). And Leviathan dominates the proud (Job 41:34). Job should humble himself before God since he has no hope of domesticating Leviathan—and God is greater than Leviathan (Job 41:10).

Where is the Gospel?

Most ancient minds thought chaos and order were in constant battle. Sometimes chaos would win, other times order would win.The best you could do was hedge your bets, worship the right gods, and pray you make it out alive. But the Bible understands that God is in charge of both chaos and order. Both Behemoth and Leviathan are on leashes. 

So far the book of Job tells us that neither justice nor innocence can fully explain why we suffer or don’t suffer. Not all suffering is because we’ve sinned. Not all blessings come because we deserve them. And sometimes suffering comes for no reason at all. It can seem as if chaos is the only option left. We think maybe God doesn’t have a master plan. Sometimes the forces of chaos just win. 

But God’s last speech to Job reminds him that no suffering is in his blindspot. There are no chaotic monsters more powerful than him. And God proves it by becoming an innocent sufferer. 

Jesus was at the mercy of seemingly chaotic forces. One of Jesus’ disciples betrayed him. The rest ran away and one, in a panic, ran away naked (Mark 14:51-52). Jealous Pharisees present Jesus to a cowardly Pilate who flogs him pointlessly (John 19:1), only to have an angry mob lawlessly exonerate a murderer so that an innocent man might be crucified. Soldiers even rolled dice to see who got to strip Jesus naked in a game of chance (Matthew 27:35). There seemed to be no order in Jesus’ death, no master plan—just chaotic evil vented on an innocent sufferer. 

But God had the chaos of Jesus’ death on a leash. The Apostle Peter says that Jesus’ lawless crucifixion was actually according to the definite plan of God (Acts 2:23). The most chaotic act in history, when the God of Life suffers and innocently dies, was part of his master plan. 

Jesus proves that uncontrolled chaos can’t be the reason why we suffer because God has chaos on a leash. Neither Pilate nor Leviathan can break free from him. 

Rather than blame God for our suffering, both Job and Jesus invite us to humble ourselves before a God whose Leviathan-like power controls Behemoth-like chaos. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who controls chaos. And may you see Jesus as proof that no innocent suffering is beyond the reach of God’s control."

When Jesus refuses to recant in his suffering, he breaks the accusations of his enemies.",Website,Job Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Job and his friends have been arguing with each other since chapter three; chapters 22-27 contain the last cycle of speeches between them. It’s the most intense and shortest cycle. The escalating tension and the shortening speeches clue us in that the Accuser’s challenge to God, from chapters one and two, is about to be resolved.

Eliphaz doubts that Job’s desire for a court case will be of any use to him (Job 22:3). Since Eliphaz believes Job lacks humility or respect for God, he tells Job the verdict in his case is guaranteed to be guilty (Job 22:4). He lists Job’s supposed crimes and describes the fate of wicked people like him (Job 22:9, 16). Eliphaz promises that if Job humbles himself, God’s wealth will become his and he will be in a better position to influence God through his prayers (Job 22:25, 27).

Job refuses this temptation. Instead, he holds out hope that God will hear his case and rule in his favor (Job 23:4-5). Job counters Eliphaz’s description of the wicked and their punishments by describing all the ways the wicked prosper (Job 24:14). 

Bildad has had enough. He resorts to platitudes about God’s majesty and man’s unworthiness by comparison (Job 25:5). With no subtlety, he calls Job a worm and a maggot (Job 25:6). To Bildad, God’s majesty is proof enough that Job is rightfully suffering for something he did wrong.

Job responds with a hymn about God’s cosmic power (Job 26:9). He points out that God’s incomprehensible majesty doesn’t prove his guilt, it proves we have barely scratched the surface of how God orders his universe (Job 26:14). To Job, Bildad’s worldview is too small in light of the vastness of God. 

Job refuses to deny his integrity or repent for sins he never committed (Job 27:6). Job then calls his friends his enemies (Job 27:7) and pronounces a long curse, predicting they will suffer like him (Job 27:20).

Where is the Gospel?

These speeches represent an end to the Accuser’s challenge to God (Job 1:9-10). Remember, Job isn’t on trial; God is. More specifically, the accusation is against the way God runs his universe.

If Job had admitted his guilt in order to be rewarded, both his friends and the Accuser would be proven right. You can imagine his friends saying, “See, we knew you were hiding something!” The Accuser would have then turned to God and said, “See, your management of the universe is flawed. Job was just obeying you for your rewards.”

But since Job both refused to curse God and refused to repent of things he didn’t do in an attempt to get God’s rewards, the arguments of the Accuser are defeated. Innocent suffering doesn’t lead Job to curse God. God’s rewards don't undermine Job’s integrity. Because of Job, the Accuser’s arguments are totally disarmed.

Like Job, Jesus refuses to repent in the face of false accusations. The religious elite accused Jesus of wrongly claiming to be God (Matthew 26:65). And their framing of Jesus as a rival king to the emperor was unfounded (Matthew 27:11). Like Job, Jesus refuses to curse God because of his innocent suffering (Luke 23:46).

When Jesus refuses to recant in his suffering, he breaks the accusations of his enemies (Colossians 2:15). He disarms their condemnation because Jesus is God, and he was the King of the Jews. When he rises from the grave, he shames their accusations because his resurrection is proof that he truly is both God and King.

If we refuse to curse God and instead insist that we are innocent because of Jesus’ cross, our accusers are silenced, as well (Colossians 2:14). Because of Jesus’ death and resurrection, we have irrefutable proof that we are not who our accusers say we are, but who God declares us to be.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see that God rewards those who seek him. And may you see Jesus as the innocent sufferer, who disarms every accusation of our enemies."

Job’s friend Eliphaz begins his second speech. In the first, Eliphaz encouraged Job to trust in his integrity (Job 4:6). Now, he accuses Job of undermining his integrity by the things he says (Job 15:4). He believes Job’s words are twisted rationalizations for his sin (Job 15:5). 

In Job’s last speech, he demanded proof from his friends that he had done something immoral to deserve his suffering. Eliphaz now responds by saying Job doesn’t need to look further than his own mouth for evidence against him. (Job 15:6).

Eliphaz then launches into long poetic descriptions about the destiny of the wicked. Since Job has lost everything he owns and refuses to recant his innocence, Eliphaz is happy to lump Job in with anyone else who rebels against God (Job 15:25).

Job has heard all of this before and rejects Elpihaz’s comments (Job 16:2-3). Job admits his suffering is evidence (Job 16:8), but it’s not evidence that proves his guilt (Job 16:17). Job knows he’s innocent. His suffering only proves that God is attacking him. He even compares God to a predator stalking his prey (Job 16:9).  

Job then intensifies his cry for an advocate (Job 16:20). He prays that some heavenly being will bear witness to his innocence and argue his case with God, just as he might argue with a friend (Job 16:19, 21). 

Job is confident this kind of intercession is impossible after he dies (Job 17:14-15). So Job wants to be declared innocent now. He wants his day in court and his integrity returned to him. 

Where is the Gospel?

The biggest difference between Job and his friends centers around the idea of rewards. Job’s friends are at their most eloquent when they describe either the loss or the gaining back of God’s rewards. But Job isn’t interested in that conversation. He’s only interested in his innocence, integrity, and the return of his good name (Job 17:9). 

Like Job, we are constantly accused. Whether it’s by our friends, our own thoughts, or Satan’s condemning comments, we all live with voices that tell us we’re guilty and not good enough. Like Job, we assume those voices are God’s, but they’re not. God doesn’t talk like the Accuser (Job 1:9). 

Instead, God sends Jesus not to condemn or accuse the world, but to save it (John 3:17). Job imagined that his innocence would be proven in some divine courtroom. And that’s exactly how Paul talked about what Jesus did on the cross. Jesus undermines every legal accusation, and nullifies every condemnation (Colossians 2:14). Jesus disarms the Accuser’s power and triumphs over his false judgments on the cross (Colossians 2:15).  

Job couldn’t imagine God as his advocate because he was so convinced God was his enemy. But in Jesus we’re shown that God always advocates for those who trust him, even when that means dying to do so.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who advocates for us. And may you see Jesus as the one who silences our enemy’s accusations and declares us innocent."

Proverb’s teaching about money might be one of the most misunderstood. It can seem like Solomon is saying that wise people always get rich and poverty can always be blamed on people’s foolishness. For example: 

“Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth” (Proverbs 10:4).

In fact, Lady Wisdom’s promises, “With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity” (Proverbs 8:18). But as we’ve said before, proverbs are not promises. While it’s often true that wise people get rich and foolish people become poor, that’s not always guaranteed. 

Solomon understands that poverty is not always a choice, but often the fault of crooked people taking advantage of loopholes in the system (Proverbs 13:23). He also knows foolish people still get rich, even if he believes that wealth will soon disappear (Proverbs 11:18). The understanding of wealth and poverty in Proverbs is nuanced even while it holds out the idea of generously compensating hard, wise work. 

But the most interesting thing Proverbs says about money is that it’s not enough. Our money is always under threat. Whether from market forces or ransom notes, money carries a unique burden (Proverbs 13:8). Besides that, money can’t save us from natural disasters, stock-market crashes, war, or the death of loved ones (Proverbs 11:4). 

Money is not enough, so we shouldn’t wear ourselves out trying to get wealthy (Proverbs 23:4-5). A wise man named Agur asked God to give him “neither poverty nor riches” (Proverbs 30:7). Agur recognized that both too much wealth and too much poverty are dangerous. Wealth makes it easy to forget God, while poverty makes it easy to dishonor him.

A helpful way to summarize everything Proverbs says about money is this: “Wise people don’t look for money. Wise people look for wisdom. And while it’s not guaranteed, money often follows.”

Where is the Gospel? 

This is Solomon’s story. In 1 Kings 3, Solomon is given a choice. He can receive any gift he wants from God, but instead of choosing power or money, he chooses wisdom. God responds to Solomon’s request for wisdom by giving him what he asked for, but also the gifts of wealth and power he didn’t request. That’s the whole teaching of Proverbs applied to money: “Get wisdom … and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you” (Proverbs 4:7-8).

This is also the teaching of Jesus. Speaking to a crowd of people anxious about their next meal, he tells them to “ seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well” (Matthew 6:33). Food is not enough; it is always under threat. Even if Jesus fills people, they will be hungry tomorrow—which is exactly what Jesus says after he feeds the 5,000 (John 6:27). 

More important than food or money is the wisdom Jesus offers. Jesus left his home of infinite abundance and wealth to live and create a Kingdom with us (Philippians 2:6, 10). To most, it’s foolishness to trade a position in God’s palace to die a servant’s death. But Jesus’ willingness to give up everything ensures that anyone who trusts in the wisdom of his poverty will become rich in his Kingdom (2 Corinthians 2:8-9). 

It will always seem like we have neither enough money nor food. But when we look for and believe Jesus’ wisdom, we get the riches of Jesus’ resurrection.

Proverbs 1-9 is a series of ten lectures given by King Solomon to his son, occasionally interrupted by Lady Wisdom. Lady Wisdom is a character that functions as the embodiment and public declaration of Solomon’s wisdom. Lady Wisdom encourages the nation of Israel to pursue after her and to avoid foolishness and its inevitable consequences. In the first interruption, Lady Wisdom shouts at the entrance of a large city. She encourages its citizens to look for wisdom in her rather than the allure of the markets and entertainments inside (Proverbs 1:20-33). 

The seductions of the city are obvious—easy money and easy sex. Both Lady Wisdom and the Father warn that money gained dishonestly and casual sex are far more costly than they appear. While both are enticing on the surface, they always lead to death, destruction, and chaos (Proverbs 1:32, 2:18-19). Easy money and easy sex should be avoided because of the foolishness they inspire. Israel and Solomon’s son must seek wisdom if they are to be spared from folly.

Over and over again Solomon promises his son that if he seeks wisdom he will find it (Proverbs 2:5, 3:13-15, 4:7-9). If he searches for wisdom, God will grant it (Proverbs 2:6). Wisdom will fill him (Proverbs 1:23), will protect him (Proverbs 2:11), instruct him (Proverbs 2:9), and deliver him from evil (Proverbs 2:12). True wisdom is found in running from evil and running towards God. Adam and Eve failed to do this in the garden, which is why Solomon often compares the pursuit of wisdom as a return to Eden (Proverbs 3:18, 4:23). 

Adam and Eve rejected God’s wisdom because the forbidden fruit looked good to eat (like easy sex and easy money often do). But its end was death. They trusted the promise of foolishness and did not heed the call of Lady Wisdom. That’s why the Father pleads with his son to not trust his instincts, understanding, or his own wisdom, but instead to fear the Lord (Proverbs 3:5-7). We cannot undo Adam and Eve’s folly, escape death, or be blessed by God unless we seek after and trust the Lord’s wisdom.  

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus is unapologetic that he is wiser than Solomon. He rebukes a large and unbelieving crowd by reminding them that the Queen of Sheba “came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here” (Luke 11:31). Jesus is Solomon’s wisdom in the flesh. Jesus is Lady Wisdom.

The lessons Solomon taught his son are publicly embodied in Jesus' ministry and teaching. In fact, some of the most common audiences of Jesus’ teachings are the unjustly wealthy and the sexually immoral. Jesus’ wisdom to them is that 

he 

and his kingdom are better than easy money and easy sex (Mark 10:23). 

And just as Lady Wisdom calls Israel to turn from their sin so she can place her spirit in them, Jesus promises the same (Proverbs 1:23; Luke 11:10-12). Anyone who asks, seeks, and knocks after him will be given the Spirit of Wisdom. While easy money and easy sex falsely promise the straightest path to happiness, Jesus’ wisdom promises we will have more in him than we could ever find in a bank account or relationship. Jesus invites us to trust in him “with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight” (Proverbs 3:5-6).

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God’s wisdom as good news. And may you see that good wisdom fully embodied in Jesus Christ."

God made the world through words (Genesis 1:3). He spoke—and everything we know was born. It is only by God’s wise words that we and our planet have life. And it was by God’s word that the world was cursed (Genesis 3:17). Proverbs 18:21 says it this way: “The tongue has the power of life and death.” This ultimately applies to God but it also applies to us. God has given humans the unique power of giving life and death through words. 

Our words have the power to incite either love or violence. “The lips of fools … invite a beating … and their lips are a snare to their very lives” (Proverbs 18:6-7). Our words can shame and judge others or they can be a means of mercy. “Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife; quarrels and insults are ended”(Proverbs 22:10). Proverbs understands that humans made in the image of their God carry great power. In fact, our words don’t just impact personal relationships, the security and success of cities can rest in the words of their influencers (Proverbs 11:11).

Wise people choose their words carefully because “truthful lips endure forever” (Proverbs 12:19). Wise people also chose their timing carefully. No matter how beautiful someone sings, nobody wants to hear it at 5 AM (Proverbs 27:14). The inclination to share the right words at the right occasion is wisdom; it’s the way you and your tongue were meant to work.  Proverbs recognizes the power of the tongue to give life or death; wise people choose to use their tongue to give life. 

Where is the Gospel?

Our problem is that our mouth gives us away. Like the book of Proverbs taught, Jesus said that words are all you needed to tell the state of a person’s heart (Matthew 15:18). Jesus even warns us that it will be our own words that are used to save or condemn us (Matthew 12:36). We would all be horrified and humiliated if every word we’ve ever said was uploaded to the Internet. 

But the good news is that Jesus' words are more powerful than ours. His words are always perfect and they always give life (Mark 5:41). And at Jesus’ last words on the cross—“It is finished”—every evil, flippant, or careless word we’ve said is deleted (John 19:30). For anyone who says, “I believe,” Jesus removes our words from our reputation as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12).

And because of Jesus, the wise words that spoke healing into withered hands, lifeless bodies, demonized minds, and dead hearts now live inside of us. (Matthew 12:13, 8:16; John 14:16-18). Our words no longer bring shame but are given the power to speak life and grace to those who hear us (Ephesians 4:29). 

Now we can boldly pray in God’s presence without worrying about saying the wrong thing. We can confidently expect that he will answer our prayers (Hebrews 4:16). While the words “it is finished” and “I believe” might sound insignificant, praise God that he is willing to use simple words to grant us his great salvation.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who brought forth life and creation with wise words. And may you see Jesus, the Word made flesh, who gives new life to us and our words."

Jesus' crucifixion is humble and weak, but it is more powerful than all man's philosophies and power.",Website,Proverbs Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Proverbs 30 and 31 are the only chapters of Proverbs written by non-Jews. They’re evidence that God’s wisdom is not confined to a particular people. God’s wisdom belongs to anyone who fears the Lord. Agur, our first Gentile philosopher, wants you to walk away from his chapter understanding the inevitable consequences of misplaced pride and the ironic success of the truly humble. 

Agur begins by humbly listing what he doesn’t know in a series of rhetorical questions (Proverbs 30:2-4) before admitting that God’s words are the only words that will prove true. Any prideful attempt to add to God’s wisdom will be shown for foolishness (Proverbs 30:6). So Agur, in the only prayer in Proverbs, asks God to make him content with a humble life—a life of neither poverty nor riches. Agur knows that either too much or too little will bend his heart away from God, so he asks God to spare him from either temptation (Proverbs 30:7-9).

The rest of the chapter lays out for the reader the consequences of pride and the ironic rewards of humility. Pride leads people to slander wait staff, curse fathers, and take advantage of the poor (Proverbs 30:10-14). Pride blinds people to their own faults (Proverbs 30:12).  Pride also enables people to justify cheating on their spouse (Proverbs 30:20). Like a desert or a barren womb, pride is never satisfied and always wants more of what it doesn’t have (Proverbs 30:16). And as expected as a nosebleed is for a boxer, the proud get what’s coming to them.

Humility, on the other hand, is mysterious—like an eagle that soars even though he doesn’t move his wings (Proverbs 30:19). Nature is full of similar surprises: the tiny ant and his vast network of underground storehouses, the leaderless locust who marches in formation, the unimpressive lizard who eavesdrops in king’s palaces (Proverbs 30:25-28). Agur’s wisdom is that while pride inevitably leads to a fall, humility is mysteriously and ironically rewarded. 

Where is the Gospel?

Agur agrees with the apostle Paul who said that “God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.” (1 Corinthians 1:27). Our world does not believe this. Our world values strength, power, and competence (or, at the very least, the appearance of those things). 

But God has determined to destroy the wisdom of the world (1 Corinthians 1:19). He’s chosen to use things like badgers and ants and crucified men “to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him.” (1 Corinthians 1:28-29). Agur’s wisdom is that, as ironic as it seems, there are rewards waiting for those who humble themselves.

In Jesus and his cross, we see God himself completely humiliated. The world will look at that and say it’s foolishness. But while the “message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God…  For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength” (1 Corinthians 1:18, 25). 

For anyone willing to accept Jesus’ foolishness and abandon their pride, the mysteries and powers of humility will become theirs. While an ant’s storehouse, a locust’s organization, and a lizard’s stealth are impressive, they are nothing when compared to the resurrection power of Jesus in the life of those who are humble. While we might feel unimpressive, the Gospel of Jesus’ humble death makes us into a mystery that angels stand on tiptoe to see (1 Peter 1:12).

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has hidden in his world the wisdom of humility and Jesus Christ as proof of its ironic power."

Proverbs is a book of wisdom. It’s about how the world works, how to avoid its evils, and how to experience God’s blessing. In the opening verses, Solomon tells us the two purposes of his book: the audience he’s writing to and the heart of true wisdom.

Proverb’s first purpose is to make us recognize and understand wisdom when we hear it (Proverbs 1:2). Its second purpose is to teach us what is wise (Proverbs 1:3). The audience for Solomon’s message is everyone (Proverbs 1:5-6), but it’s particularly written to young and immature people (Proverbs 1:4). In fact, much of the book is framed as a series of lectures given by a father to his son. 

“Wisdom” in Scripture is defined in a few different ways. Wisdom can be technical mastery--like the kind exercised by the tailors who made the priest’s clothes and the metal workers who carved the decorations for the tabernacle (Exodus 28:3, 31:3). Wisdom can also be the ability to mete out just verdicts,  as Solomon did when he intervened in a maternal custody battle (1 Kings 3:28). Wisdom is even the ability to lead a nation (Deuteronomy 34:9). In a broader sense, wisdom is understanding how life (or people, nations, or objects) work and then using that knowledge to respond appropriately, justly, or skillfully. 

That’s why Solomon’s first piece of wisdom is not a wise saying; it’s a statement about the nature and heart of true wisdom. Solomon says, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge” (Proverbs 9:10).

If wisdom is both understanding and responding to the way the world works, you cannot be truly wise without understanding and responding to the one who created the world and designed how it works (Proverbs 3:19-20). True wisdom must take into account the Creator and the wisdom he used to form the world and its people. 

Solomon warns that anyone who rejects the wisdom built into the world is a fool. Fools can expect death (Proverbs 1:18). Being a fool carries steep consequences because of its rejection of God. The pursuit or rejection of wisdom is a moral choice between good and evil. The book of Proverbs invites us to choose wisdom, gain understanding, and order our lives in accord with the Creator of life by humbly accepting and fearing the Lord.

Where is the Gospel?

God made the world with perfect wisdom (Proverbs 3:19) The Apostle John clarifies by saying that Jesus created the world and everything was made by his hand (John 1:3). And the Apostle Paul will say that in Christ “are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Colossians 2:3) 

But the wisdom of God is not primarily seen in Jesus’ ability to create the world. More so, it is seen in Jesus’ death and resurrection. The Apostle Paul says “we preach Christ crucified … the power of God and the wisdom of God” (1 Corinthians 1:23-24). The world works according to the dual principles of God’s creative power and Jesus’ sacrificial death. 

For many, the idea of obeying or fearing a Creator God is foolishness; for others the idea of a God who died and rose from the dead is bizarre. But to Christians, God is our fundamental reality; resurrection is the organizing principle of our world. 

We observe that in the way nature works. Seeds must be buried and die before the harvest is collected (1 Corinthians 15:36). The Apostle Paul points out that the wisdom applied to created seeds should also apply to our created bodies (1 Corinthians 15:42). If seeds can be raised from the dead by God’s wisdom, so can we!

Jesus’ death and resurrection should, in one way, be expected as you look at the wise way the world works. But more importantly, it’s the guarantee that resurrection life and wisdom come to those who fear the Lord, while death and foolishness follow all those who reject the wisdom of Jesus. If you want a resurrection life, choose wisdom. Choose Jesus.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who orders the world with wisdom. And may you see Jesus’ death and resurrection as the place where God’s wisdom is demonstrated most clearly."

In this song, David praises God’s strength in two ways. He thanks God for what his strength has done for him in the past and puts his trust in what God’s strength will accomplish for him in the future (Psalm 21:1). 

God uses his strength to richly bless David (Psalm 21:3a). He’s given David a crown, eternal life, glory, splendor, majesty, and more (Psalm 21:5). 

God uses his strength in this way because he promised an eternal blessing to David—that one of his descendants would sit on his throne forever (2 Samuel 7:13). 

All the blessings David celebrates are tied to this throne. That is why David puts his trust in God’s unfailing love for him and his descendants. He knows that whatever happens, his kingdom and his throne will not be shaken (Psalm 21:7). 

But many threats seek to shake David from his throne, which is why David trusts in God’s strength for his future as well.

David trusts that God’s strong hand will protect him and his throne from their enemies (Psalm 21:8). This time God’s strength doesn’t bring a crown, splendor, and majesty, but instead fire, a furnace, and a drawn bow (Psalm 21:9). 

No matter how they scheme against David or his throne, God will turn their wicked plans against them (Psalm 21:11). In the end, God will be seen as greater than any other power because of the way he uses his strength to crown David and protect his throne (Psalm 21:13). 

Where is the Gospel? 

God’s strength is seen fully in Jesus. Jesus is the promised descendant of David who is crowned with God’s strength and protects his throne from his enemies (Matthew 1:1). 

But Jesus took his throne and defeated his enemies in an unexpected way.

Enemies schemed against the final son of David to crucify him. The King of the universe received a crown of thorns (Matthew 27:29). The God who was clothed in starlight was stripped naked (Matthew 27:28). The eternal Son of God, whose days knew neither beginning nor end, died on a cross (Matthew 27:50). 

But this is exactly how God uses his strength to conquer his enemies and show his unfailing love to David. Even in the weakness of his death, God shows himself to be immeasurably strong by raising Jesus from the grave (Ephesians 1:19-20). 

In Jesus’ death and resurrection, we see the clearest picture of how God’s strength is made perfect in weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). 

Through the cross, Jesus is given the throne above every throne, and strength above all strength (1 Peter 3:22). 

And now, he uses his strength to take those of us who were his enemies and give us all the crowns, splendor, and majesty David prayed for (1 Peter 5:4).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God of all strength. And that you will see Jesus who uses that strength to go to the cross for us. "

Anyone who loves him will be like a thriving tree.,Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening in Psalm 1? 

Psalm 1 deals with how we can be blessed and how we can be in a happy, right relationship with God (Psalm 1:1a). It separates the world into two categories—the righteous and the wicked (Psalm 1:6). The righteous are those who are right with God, while the wicked are not. The difference between the two is in where they are planted. 

The wicked are described as living and working in evil. They walk in guilt, take their stand on wrongdoing, and finally plant themselves in pride (Psalm 1:1b). They believe this way of life will make them thrive, but it only leads them to wither and die. That is why the wicked are described as chaff. Chaff is the worthless and dead part of a stalk of grain that is easily blown away by the wind (Psalm 1:4). They are like dandelion fuzz destroyed with a single breath.

But the righteous are pictured as a healthy, fruit-bearing tree because they are planted by a stream of water (Psalm 1:3a). They are not chasing what they think will make their lives thrive. Instead, they are resting in what God says will make them thrive–God’s law (Psalm 1:2). The “law” refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. This psalm tells us that meditating on God’s Word brings life and thriving. 

Being blessed—or prospering as this psalm calls it—is to be by the stream. This tree always has healthy leaves and puts out its fruit in season because it constantly draws nourishment from the stream. He or she prospers because they're living a life informed by God’s Word. 

The wicked wither because they aren’t connected to the source of life (Psalm 1:5). The righteous flourish because they are deeply rooted.

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus picks up on these ideas in his famous Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5-7. Like this psalm, he begins his message with the word “Blessed” (Matthew 5:6). Also like this psalm, he ends his message with a word about the different fates of the righteous and the wicked (Matthew 7:26). 

Jesus agrees with Psalm 1 by saying the difference is that the wicked perish because he never knew them (Matthew 7:23). They were not planted by his stream. 

Jesus’ point is that he is the stream of life from Psalm 1 (John 7:37). Blessing comes to those who plant themselves next to him. This isn’t done through striving, like the wicked who walk, stand, and sit. We plant ourselves in Jesus by resting, trusting, and believing in who Jesus is (John 7:38). 

The proud and wicked walk away from this stream, which makes them wither and die. The righteous plant themselves next to it and live. Don’t walk in your own strength. You will wither. Trust in Jesus and you will thrive. Don’t stand on what you can do. You will dry up. Plant yourself in what Jesus has done for you, and you will flourish. Don’t sit stubbornly in your own pride. You will die. Rest humbly in Jesus—and you will live. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God whose very presence and Word are blessings. And may you see Jesus as the full and final stream by which we are planted and made to grow. "

As you read Proverbs you’ll be tempted to see Solomon’s wisdom as disjointed, secular, and absolute. Let’s address each of these in turn. 

From Proverbs chapters 10 to 29, it’s easy to feel lost. It can feel like you’re reading a long list of disjointed bits of wisdom—and sometimes that might be true. The list moves quickly from talking about obedient children (Proverbs 10:1) to financial management (Proverbs 10:2), to the importance of a decent work ethic (Proverbs 10:3), and to the inner disposition of wise people (Proverbs 10:8). It can feel messy, but that’s part of the point. 

If wisdom is understanding the way the world works, Solomon intentionally scatters his sayings to show how getting wisdom works—in fits and starts. We gain wisdom in painful events, business seminars, parenting moments, conversations with friends, watching people—or by opening our Bibles. Bit by unconnected bit we slowly learn to live wisely in the world. Instead of being frustrated at the lack of cohesion, Solomon asks us to accept the way wisdom works and learn from his experience with it.

Some of Solomon’s wisdom seems like it has nothing to do with God—they’re insightful, secular observations. Proverbs 13:12 speaks of shattered hopes. And Proverbs 14 13 says that just because someone is laughing doesn’t mean they’re happy. It can be easy to dismiss these as secular.

But Solomon demonstrates the truth we learned back in Proverbs 1-9. God created the world and people with wisdom. There is an internal logic and a creative design that runs through every human interaction, every type of work, and every sunset. Solomon, by including these seemingly secular bits of wisdom, is actually showing us that nothing is secular. Everything points us back to God. 

Finally, you might be tempted to think these are absolute promises, not proverbs. In Proverbs 12:21 Solomon says all evil people will be punished and all righteous people will be delivered. It’s tempting to read this as an absolute promise. But Solomon is giving us wisdom, not making promises. He’s describing how the world should and often does work, but not how it actually works every time. In fact, Proverbs 13:23 tells us that injustice often prevents the righteous from getting what should come to them. 

The proverbs are only provisionally true now, but that’s not to say they won’t be absolutely true in the future. And it’s here that we most clearly see Jesus. 

Where is the Gospel?

In Jesus’ death, ascension, and promised return, we have an absolute promise that the foolish will be punished and the wise will be delivered. All the good things we hope to be true will be true. Since God did not spare his own Son, we are guaranteed that the wise in Christ will one day be given all things (Romans 8:32). 

And if that guaranteed day is coming, no action on the earth is secular, disjointed, or random. Everything matters because matter and time were created by God. Jesus is coming to right all wrongs and bring every wise and foolish deed into judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14). Nothing is disconnected, no injustice is overlooked, and no wise moment is forgotten. 

At Jesus’ return, his wisdom will reveal that nothing in your life is random, no moment was disjointed from his purpose, and all the things that should be true will be absolutely true—forever. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God whose wisdom is never disjointed or secular. And may you see Jesus, his Son, who makes all the promises of God absolute by his death and resurrection."

The book of Proverbs has a lot to say about the leadership and wisdom exercised by the king of Israel (Proverbs 29:4). But Solomon’s wisdom equally applies to all of us, whether we lead governments, families, or the late shift. He reminds us that leaders especially need both humility and wisdom (Proverbs 8:15-17). Occupying the corner office on the top floor, standing four feet taller than one’s children, or wearing the title “supervisor” can trick leaders into making more of themselves than they should. 

Leaders must remember, they are still ruled by and accountable to God. God can change their fortunes in a moment (Proverbs 21:1). Good leaders aren’t primarily motivated by profit, political power, pragmatism, or “because that’s what my parents did.” They rule by God’s wisdom (Proverbs 8:15-16). To rule any other way invites disaster, civil war, organizational distrust, and dysfunctional family systems (Proverbs 28:2). 

To lead wisely isn’t just a commitment to the principles of humility and wisdom. It means leading yourself and those in your care to love God and keep his commandments. More specifically, it means caring for the poor and advocating for justice (Proverbs 29:14, 31:8-9). In addition to seeking wisdom, Proverbs places a heavy and unique burden on leaders to protect the poor and execute justice (Proverbs 20:26, 29:14).

Where is the Gospel?

Solomon’s father David was promised by God that one of his sons would lead a kingdom that would last forever (2 Samuel 7:12-13). David hoped it would be Solomon, but it wasn’t. Solomon hoped it would be his son, but it wasn’t. While Solomon didn’t know the identity, he knew the type of king who would reign forever. Proverbs 29:14 says, “If a king judges the poor with fairness, his throne will be established forever.” Proverbs 29:4 prophecies that “By justice a king gives a country stability.” 

The son God promised David is Jesus. He was both a descendant of David and the type of king that Solomon wanted his son to become. Jesus begins his ministry by announcing “the Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor...to set the oppressed free and proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor” (Luke 4:18-19). Jesus is the wise King and leader of Proverbs. 

If you are poor, oppressed, or marginalized by your kingdom or nation, this is good news. Jesus is your King and he is going to war against corruption and evil on your behalf (Proverbs 20:8). He even fights the evil corruption of death (Acts 13:34-35). 

Unlike David and Solomon, who have decayed and decomposed, Jesus still rules uncorrupted and undecayed on his throne (Acts 13:36). 

And this is good news for those of us who are leaders because ultimately we are never the most powerful people in the room—Jesus is (Proverbs 25:2-3). This not only frees us from the weight and heaviness of leadership as we trust Jesus’ power, but it also emboldens us to sacrifice our privileges, powers, rights, and profit lines. As we sacrificially lead like Jesus, we can be confident that our families, offices, and marriages will join God’s ever-expanding Kingdom and experience his never-ending mercy.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who rules all kings. And may you see Jesus who sits on a throne administering justice to the oppressed and grace to those who lead."

David is fighting shame. His enemies have publicly humiliated him (Psalm 31:11) and David suffers under the weight of it all (Psalm 31:9). Just existing saps all his energy (Psalm 31:10). Conspiracies to dethrone him, take his life, and put someone else in power are everywhere (Psalm 31:13).

In spite of his own personal suffering and the lies around him, David holds on to what is  true about God. God knows and sees his affliction (Psalm 31:7). He has not been given over to his enemies, but is exactly where God wants him (Psalm 31:8). God is trustworthy (Psalm 31:14) and he will deliver David (Psalm 31:15). God is his refuge, fortress, and rock (Psalm 31:2). 

When David trusts God as his shelter, his name, reputation, and life will be saved from shame. This is expressed beautifully in some of David’s most famous words: “Into your hands I commit my spirit” (Psalm 31:5). 

David trusts the deepest part of his being to God’s careful and strong hands. Despite what it looks like, David knows God will rescue him from the lies swirling around him (Psalm 31:20). He’s confident God will give him honor and abundant goodness because he trusts in him (Psalm 31:19). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The threat of public shaming still thrives in our churches, news outlets, and lives. People are cancelled and careers are tanked for both justified and unjustified reasons. Social media and secretly saved texts are used as leverage against us, whether we’re in middle schools or sit in boardrooms. 

On top of the threat of public shame, our own conscience (Romans 2:15) and our spiritual accuser—Satan—shame us too (Revelation 12:10). When these accusations pile up and grow louder it’s easy to think God has abandoned us. 

But Jesus conquered our shame when he died on the cross. He even quoted this psalm before he died (Luke 23:46). And by doing so, he brought the full weight of God’s shame-cancelling power to bear at the moment of his death. 

Like David, Jesus was publicly shamed, maligned, and condemned (Mark 15:29). Though he was guiltless he publicly suffered as if he was guilty (2 Corinthians 5:21). 

Like David, those around Jesus equated his suffering with God’s rejection (Mark 15:32). But Jesus knew God saw his affliction and would be his vindicating shelter (1 Peter 2:23). 

When Jesus rises from the dead, he answers David’s prayer in a way David couldn’t imagine. Not even Jesus’ death at his enemy’s hands would prevent the vindication of his name from public shame. Just as his humiliation was public, so Jesus’ resurrection publicly silenced the accusations of his enemies. 

If you trust in Jesus you can be confident that the stigma of your shame will be removed (Hebrews 12:2). When we commit our spirit into Jesus’ capable hands, he promises that we will be raised as he was (Romans 6:4). No shame, ridicule, lie, or condemnation will ever stick to us because our identity is hidden in the strong fortress of Jesus’ honor and goodness (Romans 8:1). Just as publicly as we have been shamed, Jesus promises to publicly shame our enemies and honor us in front of them all. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God whose hands are trustworthy to carry us through shame. And may you see Jesus as the one who took our shame on the cross and rose to give us his honor."

The book of Psalms is divided into five smaller books, and this psalm is the last one in the first smaller book. Psalm 41 begins with the same word as Psalm 1: Blessed. In fact, four out of five of the Psalter's concluding psalms talk about being “blessed.”

These connecting details tell us as readers that the Psalms as a whole, not just as individual poems, have something to teach about a life that’s blessed by God. There is wholeness, peace, and stability offered to anyone who loves to do what God has commanded (Psalm 1:1-2).

Psalm 41 points out the blessed life doesn’t come apart from caring for the weak (Psalm 41:1). But as it stands, David does not feel blessed. He’s crippled with sickness and surrounded by enemies just waiting for him to die (Psalm 41:3, 5). In this psalm, David is the weak one who needs God's blessing and healing. 

David also says he’s sinned (Psalm 41:4). David’s life proves the point of Psalm 1. As David walks away from God’s Word and commands, he withers and his enemies threaten to blow him away and never return (Psalm 1:4, 41:8). David’s fearful that a close friend—someone he’s shared bread with—will deal his final blow (Psalm 41:9).

But David knows he will receive more help from the God he wronged, than from the friend he fed (Psalm 41:10). David knows that even though God is disciplining him now, God still loves him. After all, his enemy hasn’t won yet (Psalm 41:11)! David has sinned, but because he still honors the Lord, he’s confident God will make him flourish again in his presence (Psalm 41:12).

David’s anticipated deliverance causes him to shout in praise and end the first book of Psalms with this: “Praise to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen” (Psalm 41:13).

Where is the Gospel?

One of Jesus' most famous speeches is the Sermon on the Mount. In it, he describes the people who will be blessed and experience God’s Edenic Kingdom (Matthew 5:3). It’s Jesus’ version of Psalm 1, as he describes what it’s like to be planted by the stream of God’s Word. People who are hungry for goodness and justice, people who love mercy and make peace, will be satisfied when they see God and inherit a world at peace (Matthew 5:6, 9). 

But these types of people are not kings with power; they’re more like David on his deathbed. They’re poor in spirit, mourning, weak, and surrounded by enemies (Matthew 5:5). Just like Psalm 41, Jesus says that victory doesn’t belong to the strong but the weak who trust in God. 

Jesus proves his own teaching true. The night he’s arrested Jesus quotes Psalm 41 when he shares a final slice of bread with his close friend Judas, who later betrays him (Psalm 41:9, John 13:18).  And similarly to David, Jesus suffers because of sin, although not his own. The prophet Isaiah says that Jesus’ suffering was for our sins and his stripes were for our sicknesses (Isaiah 53:5). Only when Jesus died under the weight of our sin and sickness did he rise from the dead. Like David hoped, Jesus’ integrity means he now lives in God’s presence forever (Psalm 41:12). Jesus’ death and resurrection prove the point of his Sermon on the Mount: victory belongs to the weak who trust in God.

And the same is true for us. If we are betrayed, weak, sick, or sinful, we are precisely the type of people God delights to save. When we trust God and his words, our withering stops. Jesus plants us in his presence the way a good gardener plants a tree by rivers of water (Psalm 1:3).

Everyone who loves Jesus and does what he commands will thrive. Wholeness, peace, and stability are offered to anyone who loves Jesus and follows his commands (Psalm 1:1-2). Just like Jesus promises his disciples, his presence be with us always, even until the end (Matthew 28:20). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who rescues the weak. And may you see Jesus as the one who becomes weak so that we can be blessed."

Psalm 23 is a psalm of comfort. David imagines God as a caring shepherd and himself as one of his lambs (Psalm 23:1). Under his care, David is confident he will have everything he needs. 

Like a lamb needs to be led to food and water when wandering in the deserts of Israel, God leads David to rare fields of green grass and calm waters (Psalm 23:2). God’s gentle shepherding both restores David to full vitality and ensures he chooses the right paths (Psalm 23:3).

God shepherds David not just because he loves him, but for his own name’ sake (Psalm 23:3). Leading David along paths of righteousness is a matter of God’s character. And David is confident God will never fail to lead him—even when that means bravely leading him through the most threatening places (Psalm 23:4a). God will most certainly beat away predators with his rod and point the way with his staff. In God’s presence David has no reason to fear (Psalm 23:4b).

Like a generous host to his honored guests God fights for their protection so they can feast and drink wine, even when surrounded by enemies (Psalm 23:5). 

David knows that with God, it won’t be enemies who stalk him, but goodness and mercy (Psalm 23:5a). Ultimately God the shepherd will lead him to dwell forever in his generous and protective presence (Psalm 23:6). 

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus identifies himself as the Shepherd of Psalm 23 (John 10:14). And he refers to his disciples as lambs in need of protection and provision (Luke 12:32). When crowds of people came to him—sick, suffering, and in need of food—Jesus saw them like David saw himself, as sheep in need of a shepherd (Matthew 9:36). He literally prepared a table and fed 5,000 men and their families by the still waters of Galilee (John 6:11).

Jesus is the Good Shepherd who cares for and leads his flock. And just as David’s shepherd walked through the Valley of Death to provide a feast for his sheep in his presence, Jesus does the same.

When Jesus walked into the valley of his grave, his rod beat away the predators of sin and death (1 Peter 5:8). And when Jesus walked out of his tomb, his staff points out there is a feast of life in him. And now that Jesus is raised from the dead, his Spirit follows us all the days of our life (John 14:26). Jesus is our shepherd; God’s house of goodness and mercy now dwells in us (Ephesians 2:22). Because Jesus is our shepherd we can live in God’s generous and protective presence forever.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is our Shepherd. And may you see Jesus as the Good Shepherd who goes into the Valley of Death, so that you might live with him forever."

In Psalm 32, David tells us to sing and rejoice because God has forgiven us (Psalm 32:11). Psalm 33 is the song we’re supposed to sing! It’s a new song for a new experience of God’s freedom and forgiveness (Psalm 33:3).

David gives us three reasons why we should praise God: his character, his word, and his plans. 

First, God’s character is unassailable. His words are always right and true and he never breaks his word (Psalm 33:4). God’s justice, purity, and love are evident through all the ways he has forgiven Israel from her sins and freed her from slavery, particularly in Egypt (Psalm 33:5). 

Second, God’s word is powerful to do what it says (Psalm 33:9). All he has to do is breathe and stars are born (Psalm 33:6). He can separate ocean from ocean the way we separate our laundry; he can store seas like we store gallons of milk (Psalm 33:7). 

Third, God’s plans are unstoppable. There’s no superpower that can thwart God’s purposes (Psalm 33:10). And while empires might last a few centuries, God’s dynasty never ends (Psalm 33:11). 

All this means Israel can trust God. God has chosen her to be an heir to his fortune of grace and mercy. Israel can trust that her inheritance will be nothing but blessing (Psalm 33:12). After all, God sees the world clearly. He knows the minds, motives, and strength of Israel and of her enemies (Psalm 33:13). 

And God sees that human power is a myth (Psalm 33:15). God’s loving attention is more powerful than either military size or technological advances (Psalm 33:17-18). His all-seeing eyes are on his people’s suffering and his all-powerful voice saves them (Psalm 33:18b).

In confidence Israel can refuse self-reliance and instead wait in hope (Psalm 33:20). God’s character, word, and plans all point in the same direction—He will be their strong helper and loving deliverer (Psalm 33:20-21).

Where is the Gospel?

Like Israel we’ve been forgiven by God. Like Israel we should sing new songs about God’s character, word, and plans. And since our forgiveness was earned by God in Jesus, it’s entirely appropriate to meditate on Jesus’ character, word, and plans.

First, Jesus' character is God’s character (John 5:19). When Jesus healed the sick, approached the outcast, and welcomed sinners, we see God’s justice, purity, and love on full display. Or as the author of Hebrews says, Jesus is the “radiance of God’s glory” who upholds the universe with his words (Hebrews 1:3a). 

Second, Jesus’ words were as powerful as God’s. They calmed storms, defeated demons, and inspired repentance. His last words, “It is finished,” secured our forgiveness. From the beginning of his ministry Jesus had one plan—to set the oppressed free (Luke 4:18). And even when he knows it will cost him his life he resolutely meets the danger (Luke 9:51).

Third, Jesus’ character, word, and plans were more strategic than Rome’s military complex, and more powerful than Israel’s religious hypocrisy. Even when both conspired to kill him, the plan of God to deliver his people could not be stopped (Acts 2:23).

We have a God in Jesus who accomplishes everything we need to deliver us from death (Psalm 33:19). Far from self-reliantly trying to garner enough forces to rescue ourselves, we can wait in hope that the God who rose from the dead will be our help and shield. In Jesus, God’s unfailing love rests on us forever (Psalm 33:22). Every day we have new reasons to sing new songs.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is worthy of praise. And may you see Jesus as the one whose character, word, and plans save us so completely we can wait and sing in hope of his rescue."

If we admit we've done wrong, God is willing to heal us.",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

God is disciplining David with sickness (Psalm 38:3). And David is pleading with God to end his anger towards him (Psalm 38:1). David isn’t asking God to stop because he thinks God is being unfair. David knows he’s guilty (Psalm 38:4)  and been a fool (Psalm 38:5). And David freely admits his sin and his remorse (Psalm 38:18). He asks God to stop because he can’t take it anymore (Psalm 38:7-8). David knows he doesn’t deserve God’s mercy, but he asks for God to save him anyway (Psalm 38:22). 

Most of the psalm describes David’s suffering. His wounds fester (Psalm 38:5). His back feels like it’s broken (Psalm 38:7). He’s depressed (Psalm 38:8). His heart beats erratically and his eyesight is failing (Psalm 38:10). David is so emaciated he can’t even pray, so he hopes that God’s mercy will hear the faint sighs he wheezes out through the pain (Psalm 38:9).

Besides his physical problems, David’s friends have used his sickness as an excuse to abandon him (Psalm 38:11). And David’s enemies are plotting to take advantage of his vulnerability (Psalm 38:12, 20). David’s so waylaid he can’t even summon the strength to defend himself (Psalm 38:13-14).

In agony, David confesses his sin and waits for the Lord. There’s nothing else he can do (Psalm 38:15). While he never mentions it, David clings to a hope found in the book of Proverbs: “Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy” (Proverbs 28:13). David has experienced what it’s like to not prosper, so he confesses God’s mercy is the only thing that can save him now (Psalm 38:21). 

Where is the Gospel?

Confession is vulnerable. It’s an admission we don’t have it all together and need help. We often avoid confessing because we’re ashamed or we believe others will use our confession to take advantage of us. But David discovers it’s more humiliating not to confess sin. 

God’s discipline towards David’s unconfessed sin shamed him in front of his friends, gave his enemies an opportunity to take advantage of him, and proved that he needed help. Ironically, everything David tried to avoid by not confessing is exactly what David got anyway. 

But David’s hope and ours are the same. If we confess our sins, God will be merciful to forgive us (1 John 1:9). If we admit we’ve done wrong, God is willing to heal us (James 5:16). And if we confess Jesus as the one who saves by what he did on the cross, we will never be shamed (Romans 10:9,11). Even when our sickness is a product of our sin, as it was for David, we’re told  it is by the stripes of Jesus that we are healed (Isaiah 53:5). 

When we confess our sins and trust that God has dealt with them in Jesus, we are not embarrassing ourselves or opening ourselves up to attack. Instead,we are calling on the resurrection power of God to be merciful and to save. And if anyone wonders if God really will do this, the answer is—yes (2 Corinthians 1:20)! Jesus was buried and rose again so that your forgiveness will be more certain than death. 

And if you’re crying out in need today as David did, saying, “Come quickly to help me, my Lord and my Savior” (Psalm 38:22), be comforted by Jesus’ final words in our bibles: “Yes, I am coming soon” (Revelation 22:20)!

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is merciful. And may you see Jesus as the one who comes quickly to forgive us of our sin and cleanse us from our sickness."

Like Psalms 37—39, Psalm 40 is another cry for deliverance from the consequences of sin (Psalm 40:13). David never mentions what he did to receive God’s discipline, just that his suffering is overwhelming (Psalm 40:12), and that God has always been faithful to save him. 

David describes his past disobedience as being stuck in a slimy pit. In contrast, God’s salvation lifts him up and gives him firm footing (Psalm 40:2). David knows that people who trust in the Lord will always be saved (Psalm 40:4). Israel’s past is so full of stories of God’s deliverance that people would exhaust themselves trying to retell them all (Psalm 40:5). 

Through his sufferings and discipline, David has learned that offering empty sacrifices is never what God wants (Psalm 40:6). God wants “pierced” or open ears with hearts that are attentive and love to do what God desires (Psalm 40:8). Perhaps David is being disciplined for the sin of hypocrisy. Regardless, David now praises God for his justice in disciplining—and for his love in saving him (Psalm 40:10). In Psalm 39 David was silent because of his sin (Psalm 39:1), but now he’s loud with praise (Psalm 40:9).

Knowing all this, David asks for mercy again (Psalm 40:11). He asks God to deliver him from the enemies that God sent as a punishment for his sin (Psalm 40:14). And he also asks God to save everyone who seeks and waits for God and his salvation (Psalm 40:16). 

Where is the Gospel?

The prophet Isaiah warned that if Israel turned to other nations and other gods, they would be exiled (Isaiah 31:1). In this psalm, David offers the same warning as a promise (Psalm 40:4). Anyone who does not look to proud rulers or turn to false gods will be blessed. Their enemies will be shamed (Psalm 40:14). But Israel didn’t listen to David or Isaiah. And like David, Israel fell into hypocritical patterns of worship (Isaiah 1:13). 

Isaiah hoped for a day when a new King from David’s line would reign in Israel—and the closed eyes, ears, and hearts of her people would finally be pierced and opened (Isaiah 32:3-4). 

That King is Jesus, who fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah and David. Even when we are blind and deaf, trusting ourselves more than God, Jesus opens our eyes and ears to love God and love his law (Psalm 40:6a, 8). That’s why Jesus heals a deaf man in the Gospel of Mark (Mark 7:37) and ends many of his parables with the phrase, “Whoever has ears, let them hear” (Matthew 13:9).

It’s Jesus’ way of revealing we need his help to see and hear. Closed ears are the consequence of our failure to trust God. Closed eyes are punishment for religious hypocrisy and blatant sin. But Jesus comes to open our ears, open our eyes, transform our hearts, and bless those who trust him (Matthew 13:16). 

When we turn away from trusting ourselves, others, or idols, the Apostle Paul says that the eyes of our heart will be opened (Ephesians 1:18). We will see our hope and God’s power to save when we’re surrounded by enemies or stuck in a muddy pit of our sin (Ephesians 1:19). And like the blind man, our eyes will be opened to the truth that God sees us (you and me) as an inheritance (as a treasure) worth dying to receive (Ephesians 1:18). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who lifts us out of the pit. And may you see Jesus as the one who opens our ears and hearts to hope in God’s salvation and power."

He is the one who turns our mourning into dancing.,Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

This psalm was written for the dedication of the temple in Israel. But strangely, it sounds like the psalm is describing an individual. 

That’s because the psalmist’s personal story of suffering mirrors Israel's national story with her temple (Psalm 30:1). 

The psalmist called out to God and was lifted out of certain death (Psalm 30:2). Israel, too, was lifted out of their death in Egypt after calling to God for help (Exodus 2:24-25). 

The psalmist’s escape from death was like a resurrection (Psalm 30:3). In the same way, Israel’s exodus from Egypt was like a corporate resurrection from the dead (Exodus 15:17). 

The psalmist was made solid like a mountain by God’s presence and favor (Psalm 30:7a). Israel, too, experienced God’s favor and presence on an actual mountain called Sinai (Exodus 19:16). 

But the psalmist sinned and it seemed God’s anger would make his presence go away from him (Psalm 30:7b). Israel also sinned at Mt. Sinai with their golden calves and God’s anger put his presence on the line (Exodus 33:3). 

So the psalmist begs God to save him, challenging God to consider if his death will bring God any praise (Psalm 30:9). Israel too, through Moses, challenged God to consider if their dying at Sinai would give God any praise as well (Exodus 32:12). 

Graciously, God answers the psalmist’s request and turns his wailing into dancing (Psalm 30:11). God also answered Moses’ request and brought his presence into the tabernacle, Israel’s first temple (Exodus 40:34). Like the psalmist, their mourning (Exodus 33:4) was turned into dancing (Exodus 33:10). 

All of this proves one main point, which stands in the center of the psalm. God’s anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime (Psalm 30:5). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Psalm 30 pictures God’s presence filling the temple like a person rising from the dead (Psalm 30:3). But what can only be a metaphor in this psalm becomes true in Jesus. 

That is because Jesus is God himself, the perfect combination of the localized presence of God and an individual human (Colossians 1:19). That’s why Jesus compared his death to the destruction of the temple (John 2:19).

Like the psalmist and Israel, Jesus cried out to God when faced with certain death (Matthew 26:39).  But unlike the psalmist and Israel who were saved even though they sinned, Jesus went all the way to the grave even though he was sinless (2 Corinthians 5:21). 

All the anger against the sins of the psalmist, Israel, and the world—the sins that put God’s presence on the line—was experienced by Jesus on the cross (Romans 5:9). But unlike the psalmist’s and Moses’ challenge that death would not bring God praise, Jesus earns God praise from the grave (Philippians 2:11). 

The temple of Jesus’ body was lifted up when he was raised from the dead. Now, anyone who calls out to Jesus like the psalmist cried out to God, can be raised from the dead as well (Romans 8:11). Their mourning will be turned into dancing. 

God's anger only lasted for a moment on the cross so that we can experience his favor for eternity (1 Peter 3:18). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who raises the dead. And may you see Jesus as the one who went into the grip of the grave to raise us into eternal life with him."

Like in Psalm 38, David is suffering because of his sin (Psalm 39:9). Unlike Psalm 38, David’s suffering causes him to meditate on the brevity of his life and the futility of his achievements (Psalm 39:5).

David is surrounded by enemies who are either pointing out his flaws or taking advantage of his vulnerable position (Psalm 39:1). But David says nothing because he knows he’s under God’s judgment (Psalm 39:9).

But the longer he stays silent, the more intense his emotions become. Like the prophet Jeremiah who felt like he had fire shut up in his bones when God gave him words to share, David is compelled to speak (Jeremiah 20:9).

And when he does, he wants to know just how short his life will be (Psalm 39:4). Like the author of Ecclesiastes, David proclaims that under God’s discipline his life is like a breath (Psalm 39:5). That word “breath” is the same word Ecclesiastes translates as “meaningless” (Ecclesiastes 1:2). Humans, their wealth, and all their accomplishments are like ghosts under God’s discipline (Psalm 39:11). We bustle around, affect nothing, and pass through everything (Psalm 39:6). 

David’s only hope is in God’s salvation (Psalm 39:7-8). As it stands, David feels alienated and estranged from God (Psalm 39:12). God’s disciplinary attention is too much for him, and his final prayer asks God to turn his face away before he dies (Psalm 39:13).  

Where is the Gospel?

In David’s mind the experience of meaninglessness in our efforts and the shortness of our lives is God’s rebuke of our sin (Psalm 39:10-11). If you’ve ever thought, “What’s the point of all this?” you know what David experienced. We all have moments when we feel our efforts don’t matter and our life has been wasted. In those moments we’re experiencing the consequences of a life without God. 

This psalm invites us to break our silence and call out to God to save us (Psalm 39:8-9). And when we call out to God to save us from meaninglessness and our approaching death, Jesus answers by going to battle against both.

On the cross Jesus was overwhelmed by futility and death (Psalm 39:10). What’s more meaningless than the innocent God of Life dying for sins of guilty people? The answer is nothing. Nothing is more meaningless than that. The Apostle Paul says that if Jesus didn’t rise from the dead, we’re the most pitiful people on the planet (1 Corinthians 15:19). 

But Jesus did rise. And when he rose from death and the meaninglessness of his tomb, he was just the first (1 Corinthians 15:20). Everyone who believes in Jesus now lives forever—confident that none of their efforts are wasted, but are eternally meaningful. Everyone who trusts in Jesus' resurrection can be comforted because their lives will not be short but last forever. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who judges our sin with meaninglessness and short lives. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives us meaning and offers everlasting life."

Psalm 24 was sung as pilgrims made their way through Jerusalem to worship at God’s temple. 

As they enter the city the pilgrims—no matter where they have come from—are reminded that the whole earth is the Lord’s (Psalm 24:1). Every animal, person, and nation belongs to him since he created them. God alone calmed the chaotic seas at creation, and brought order and life to the cosmos (Psalm 24:2; Genesis 1:2-3).

So the pilgrims rightfully ask, “Who on earth can stand in God’s presence?” (Psalm 24:3-4). The question is supposed to humble the pilgrims as their steps lead them closer and closer to God’s throne and His presence. 

Those who approach the God who subdues chaos should have both clean hands and pure hearts (Psalm 24:4a). They shouldn’t lift up false gods but should instead lift their eyes to the God who lifts them up by his power (Psalm 24:4b-5a). It’s humble pilgrims who will see the face of the King of all the earth (Psalm 24:6).

The pilgrims then move into the temple and invite God to come. They imagine the doors of the temple like the tired head of a weary pilgrim—and tell the gates to look up! They invite the ancient doors to fling open so they can see the King of Glory arriving in splendor (Psalm 24:7). 

God is not simply the Creator; he is also the conquering King (Psalm 24:8). As the pilgrims march toward the temple and wait for God’s presence, God is marching against their enemies. The gates are flung open not just to prepare for God’s arrival, but to proclaim to weary pilgrims that their battles are won and their enemies will never enter (Psalm 24:10).

Where is the Gospel?

We would all love to see God’s face. But God’s presence seems far away because we’re not the type of people who are allowed to enter. We know our hands commit harm. We know our hearts can’t stop wanting what’s bad for us. We know our minds think false things. We know our mouths lie (Psalm 24:4).

But the pilgrims in the psalm knew that too. They weren’t claiming to be perfect as they walked towards God’s presence. They were trusting God to bless them despite their imperfection. They believed God would vindicate them and clear them of guilt so that they could see his face (Psalm 24:5). 

The good news is that our vindication and our experience of God’s presence is not found by moral perfection, but by faith in Jesus. Jesus takes away everything that makes us unworthy to ascend God’s holy hill (1 John 3:5). 

More so than the original singers, Jesus is the pilgrim who deserves to stand in God’s presence. His hands never harm, his mouth never lies, and his heart is pure. When we lift up our eyes to see Jesus lifted up on the cross, Jesus lifts us up with the blessing of vindication—the eradication of our sins (Colossians 2:14). Now God sees us like he sees Jesus. There is nothing that can prevent us from seeing God face to face.

Our drooped heads, like those ancient doors, can now be lifted up to see the King of Glory in all his power. Jesus is risen from the dead and seated in the heavens. He has defeated the enemies of death and separation. And instead of opening temple gates, Jesus flings open our hearts and proclaims to our weary souls that all our battles are won (Matthew 11:28, Colossians 2:15). His presence is with us always, even until the end of the age (Matthew 28:18-20). 

And when that ending age arrives and God builds a new Jerusalem on earth, he promises the gates to that city will never be closed (Revelation 21:25). They will always be opened because in God’s final Kingdom there will be no more enemies who can invade. All that will be left is the arrival of our King. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who creates and conquers. And may you see Jesus as the worthy pilgrim who blesses, saves, and brings us into God’s presence."

David invites God to judge him (Psalm 26:1a). More specifically, he wants God to “vindicate” him in the eyes of his enemies. Vindication is a public declaration of both innocence and moral virtue. David wants God to call him “perfect” in the eyes of anyone who doubts it. 

David is so willing to let God judge him because he knows he’s blameless (Psalm 26:1a). Blamelessness doesn’t mean moral perfection, but wholehearted trust (Psalm 26:1b). David says this wholehearted trust is being mindful of God’s loyal love and reliant on his enduring faithfulness (Psalm 26:3).

David’s so confident in God’s enduring love that he’s willing to submit himself entirely to God’s examination (Psalm 26:2). He willingly opens himself and his relationships to God’s scrutiny (Psalm 26:4-5). And he’s confident he will be able to enter into God’s presence as if his hands are completely innocent (Psalm 26:6).

Evil men might publicly slander and threaten him (Psalm 26:9-10). But David knows that his unwavering trust will cause God to publicly declare all their slanderous schemes false—and David perfectly innocent (Psalm 26:11)

David knows he’s not perfect (Psalm 25:11). He knows God’s moral perfection should cause him to fear (Psalm 25:12). But he doesn’t live in terror that God might strike him down for some small infraction; he fears out of humble recognition that he’s entirely dependent on God’s mercy. 

Where is the Gospel?

While we might not have enemies as bloodthirsty or evil as David’s, we all know what it feels like to be misrepresented, gossiped about, or humiliated publicly. Our first normal response is to prove the rumors wrong. We want to provide evidence, talk to the people involved, and debunk the charges against us. 

David would call that vindication. The New Testament calls this being “justified.” When we are maligned and viciously slandered by the voices around us, we want to be publicly defended. And God does that for us, in Jesus. 

God publicly silences the accusations thrown at us by our enemies (Romans 8:33). God silences condemnation not by remembering our good deeds, but by remembering Jesus’ faithfulness to us. When we wholeheartedly trust Jesus’ demonstration of God’s loyal love and enduring faithfulness, we become blameless. Our hands are innocent, and nothing can separate us from God’s loving presence (Romans 8:35).

Regardless of the threats and rumors breathed out by our enemies (Romans 8:36), our trust in God through Jesus eternally declares that we are blameless.Through Jesus’ vindication we conquer every false word spoken against us (Romans 8:37). And from Jesus' throne, he speaks words of forgiveness over us even better than David ever heard (Hebrews 12:23-24). 

We stand on the solid ground of Jesus’ tomb, which was more than David hoped for (Psalm 26:12). We know that neither death, life, angels, demons, or anything in all of creation can overturn God’s verdict or our praise of him (Romans 8:38-39).

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who vindicates us in front of our enemies. And may you see Jesus who declares us eternally justified and perfectly secure because of his cross and resurrection."

Psalm 37 is an extended meditation of Psalm 1. In Psalm 1 we’re told those who love God’s Word are like sturdy trees and those who hate God’s Word are like chaff that disappear in the breeze (Psalm 1:3-4). 

But Psalm 37 expands on the truth of Psalm 1 in that sometimes the wicked are also like sturdy trees. Sometimes the wicked win. 

Our natural response to injustice is to get anxious or angry, wishing we had the power to set things right. But this is precisely what David warns we shouldn’t do (Psalm 37:1). 

Instead, we must remember the truth of Psalm 1—that the wrongly powerful will waste away (Psalm 37:2), but those who trust and delight in the Lord will remain steady forever (Psalm 37:3-4). 

Repeatedly David tells us that trusting in God and his Word alone brings stability. When we commit our ways to the Lord we’ll see vindication (Psalm 37:5). And when we are silent and wait patiently, even when others take advantage of us (Psalm 37:7-8), it’s then that we will inherit God’s wealth and land (Psalm 37:9). 

David then warns us not to make the mistake of acting like the wicked, thinking we can get away with it. Every sword, bow, or wicked plot will curve back around and strike the oppressors (Psalm 37:15). And every dollar greedily stolen will dry up (Psalm 37:21). When natural disasters strike, it will be the faithful who have plenty while everyone else will wither and vanish like smoke (Psalm 37:19-20). 

David knows God’s desire is that the righteous are never forgotten (Psalm 37:25). God loves justice and faithfulness and wants to reward it (Psalm 37:28a). He knows God will establish in his land forever everyone who hopes in him (Psalm 37:34). And while it looks like the wicked prosper for a time, the truth of Psalm 1 is not overturned. Those who hate God will soon dry up and those who love God will last forever (Psalm 37:37-38).

Where is the Gospel?

When evil seems to win, when doing right doesn't seem to pay, when the promises of God don’t seem to come true, and when God doesn’t seem to answer our prayers, it’s really tempting to fret (Psalm 37:1). It’s easy to look around anxiously at the success of those less committed to God and his Word—and wish we had it like them. We wonder if obedience to God and his Word is worth the cost, discipline, and disadvantages. 

David encourages us, that—yes—it’s worth it (Psalm 37:28). He doesn’t  tell us things will be great all the time when we trust in God, but he acknowledges the reality of wicked prosperity and innocent suffering. God’s faithfulness isn’t shown when things are always rosy for his followers on earth, but by his plan to give eternal flourishing to those who are faithful (Psalm 37:18).

And Jesus proves this to us. Jesus innocently suffered and was killed by corrupt politicians and hypocritical religious men. Jesus was faithful to God’s Word all the way to death (Philippians 2:8). And God rewarded Jesus’ faithfulness on the earth with eternal glory and power (Philippians 2:9). Every politician’s knee and every hypocritical tongue now bow to Jesus (Philippians 2:10). 

Because of Jesus, the prosperity of wicked kings is eternally cut off. Jesus is now King over every power and grants citizenship to all who have faith in him (Psalm 37:22). Jesus’ faithfulness to death is proof of God’s faithfulness to us and his determination to never see the righteous forsaken (Psalm 37:25). Even though the wicked might rule for a time, Jesus shows us God reigns forever and his plans to uproot evil and lift up those who trust in him will never fail. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who causes the wicked to vanish and the trusting to thrive. And may you see Jesus as the one who is faithful to death, so that the righteous will never be forsaken."

David is praising the Lord and wants anyone who is suffering to join him (Psalm 34:1-2). Together, they will celebrate God’s greatness (Psalm 34:3).

David’s personal experience is that when he calls on the Lord, he gets an answer (Psalm 34:4). That’s been Israel’s experience too. Poor Israel called out to the Lord in their slavery (Psalm 34:6) and God gave them an angel to surround and liberate them (Psalm 34:7). And when Moses prayed in God’s presence on Mt. Sinai God showed his nearness by lighting up Moses’ face (Exodus 34:29). David’s confident that when sufferers pray to the Lord they’ll experience the same deliverance (Psalm 34:5). 

When they take shelter in God’s presence they will taste and see that the Lord is good—just like Israel tasted their salvation in the Passover lamb (Psalm 34:8). Significantly, that lamb had no broken bones (Exodus 12:46-47). The Passover lamb was meant to be a symbol of God’s protection even in the lamb’s death. 

David then launches into a series of proverbial poems. They’re pithy verses describing what generally happens to people who trust in God. Unlike lions who fear no one but still go hungry, people who fear the Lord will lack nothing (Psalm 34:9-10).   

People who trust in God, seek peace for their neighbor, and turn away from evil will have the undivided attention of God’s eyes and ears (Psalm 34:15). God is not interested in propping up the proud, but in coming close to and saving the brokenhearted and suffering—just like he did to enslaved Israel in Egypt (Psalm 34:18). 

David is confident that though God’s people might suffer and even die, like the innocent Passover lamb their bones will not be ultimately broken (Psalm 34:19-20). God will protect his people, no matter the cost.

Where is the Gospel?

David encourages us to see that God can be trusted even when we suffer. And if it’s difficult to accept David’s personal experience or his proverbs as proof of God’s trustworthiness, perhaps you can accept Jesus’ life example. 

Jesus is living proof that the Lord is close to the brokenhearted and comes to save the crushed in spirit. Jesus not only began his ministry by telling us as much (Luke 4:18), but he demonstrated it by healing outcast lepers, chronically ill women, and even dead children. Jesus also defended sinners from the self-righteous attacks of the proud (Luke 19:10). He calls to the weary and burdened to trust in his gentleness (Matthew 11:28). 

God can be trusted with your suffering because he is gentle. 

God can be trusted with your suffering because of his sacrifice on the cross. Like the Passover lamb, Jesus’ bones were unbroken when he died (Psalm 34:20, John 19:36). It was a symbol that God’s power to save had not abandoned him. Even in his death, God protected his son and saved his people. Just as the Passover lamb acted as a symbol and promise of faithfulness in suffering, Jesus’ blood and unbroken bones prove that God was faithful in Jesus’ suffering and will be faithful in ours too. 

Jesus is our Passover lamb. And when we taste and see his goodness—when we eat his flesh and drink his blood—we will be saved (John 6:54). 

God will protect us, even in death. Because Jesus died as our Passover lamb, our bones will not be broken and our suffering will not have the last word.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is trustworthy. And may you taste and see Jesus as the good Passover lamb, who delivers us from our suffering."

David pleads with the Lord to hear his cry for mercy (Psalm 28:2). If God doesn’t answer, he’s afraid he’ll die (Psalm 28:1b).

David’s concerned that even though he’s innocent, he’ll be dragged away with the wicked (Psalm 28:3). This fear would play out in Israel’s history. Not everyone in Israel was evil when Babylon and Assyria took over their land and exiled God’s people (Isaiah 10:20). But the righteous few still experienced the consequences of the sinful many. David asks God not to let that happen to him. 

He wants God to pay evildoers the fair wage their wicked work deserves (Psalm 28:4). To David, God’s judgment is the correct salary for working a life of evil (Psalm 28:5). In this psalm David defines “evil” as people who are nice on the outside, but full of hate on the inside (Psalm 28:3b). David’s enemies used politeness to hide their plans to take him down. This is the evil work he wants repaid and torn down (Psalm 28:5). 

Throughout the Psalms we’re told that our hearts, mouths, and hands should all be aligned (Psalm 19:13a, 14). This is the hard work that God rewards. 

David then erupts into confident praise (Psalm 28:6). He trusts God has heard his cry for mercy and is now protecting him like a shield, not just from his enemies but also God’s judgment of his enemies (Psalm 28:7). David knows he will not be dragged away with them.

The final verse turns a personal prayer for mercy into a public one (Psalm 28:9). David asks God to save not just him as the anointed king, but all the citizens of his kingdom (Psalm 28:9). 

Where is the Gospel?

The idea that our hearts, mouths, and hands should be aligned is not just David’s prayer but one of Jesus’ core teachings. In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus repeatedly emphasizes that obedience from the heart is just as important as obedience with our actions (Matthew 5:27-28). To Jesus, the heart and mouth are intimately linked (Luke 6:45). 

Just like David’s enemies, Jesus’ enemies were people who misaligned their hearts from their words and actions (Matthew 23:27-28). Jesus says they’re nothing more than pretty tombs. Even worse, these enemies weren’t simply pretending to be nice, they were pretending to love God. They used religious words to hide their selfishness (Mark 7:13). When Jesus exposes their misalignment, they plot to kill him—just like David’s enemies (Matthew 12:14).

But unlike David’s expectation that God would pay hypocrites their salary of death and redeem the faithful, Jesus dies instead. Jesus is not rescued from their plots. And even though Jesus’ heart and actions are always perfectly aligned, Jesus receives the wages his enemies worked for. He dies for their sins (1 Corinthians 15:3). 

This is good news for everyone who recognizes how misaligned their hearts and actions can be. While the correct payment for hypocrisy is death, Jesus doesn’t pay us what we’re owed. While the wages of sin is death, the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23).

Jesus also frees us from constantly misaligning our mouths and actions with our hearts (Romans 6:17). Because of his Spirit, we are free to mean what we say and say what we mean (Matthew 5:37) 

But this is also good news for anyone who is the victim of other people’s nice words but evil hearts. If God was a fortress of salvation to King Jesus through death and resurrection, he can certainly protect you (Psalm 28:8). Jesus will save, bless, and carry you just as God carried him (Psalm 28:9).

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is merciful towards victims of hypocrisy. And may you see Jesus as the one who receives the payment our misaligned hearts deserve, so that we might receive his gift of eternal life."

David wonders in this psalm if God has abandoned him (Psalm 22:1). God isn't responding to his prayers (Psalm 22:2). While God had been delighted to respond and rescue David's ancestors, the same treatment doesn't seem to apply to him (Psalm 22:5). David's enemies take advantage of God's silence and mock him (Psalm 22:6). They sarcastically imply that his suffering is proof that God must not love him as he once did (Psalm 22:8). 

It's not as if David's perception of his enemies is blown out of proportion. They're vicious predators (Psalm 22:13). David is surrounded (Psalm 22:16). He feels as if his body will collapse under the stress (Psalm 22:14), not to mention the physical harm David's enemies enjoy inflicting (Psalm 22:17). Desperate, David calls out for deliverance (Psalm 22:20-21).

In that same moment of desperation, David invites all of Israel to praise God (Psalm 22:22). This praise is not for God's seeming inaction, but because of his past faithful action on their behalf. God is not the type of God to abandon the afflicted and the victimized (Psalm 22:24). Just as God heard the cries of his people in Egypt, delivered them from slavery, and provided them food in the wilderness, David is confident God will move towards the afflicted again and feed them (Psalm 22:26).

 (Psalm 22:27). Both the poor and the rich will bow before the God who sustains their life (Psalm 22:29). And all future generations will proclaim the faithfulness of the God who delivers and saves forever (Psalm 22:30-31).

Where is the Gospel?

This song of lament is used 24 times in the New Testament as a way to interpret and explain Jesus' death and crucifixion. Some of Jesus' last words on the cross are taken from the first verse of this psalm: ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" (Matthew 27:46).

The sarcastic jabs David received are repeated in the mouths of the Pharisees and Romans toward Jesus (Luke 23:35, 37). Stripped and left naked in a game of chance (John 19:24), Jesus could easily count all of his bones (Psalm 22:17). As Jesus' cross was raised and then dropped into a hole, many of his bones would have dislocated (Psalm 22:14). 

Both David and Jesus model for us how to pray while we're suffering. We shouldn't use religious words when brutal ones are more true. We should express the depth of our pain to God. And like both David and Jesus, we should pray in hope that God will deliver. 

When we look at the ways we've suffered, it's easy to think God has abandoned us. But that's not true. On the cross, Jesus inhabited the forsakenness we so often experience. And not simply to sympathize with us, but to demonstrate that anyone who trusts in him will never be abandoned. 

Jesus rose from the dead! While it looked like God had left Jesus to die, God would not allow his precious son to be abandoned to the grave (Acts 2:27). And the same goes for you. Jesus promises to satisfy your afflicted soul with eternal food (Luke 22:19; John 6:35). He will not abandon to the grave those he has made his family (Hebrews 2:11-12). 

Because of Jesus' resurrection, we know life will win over our suffering and death. In the same way David hoped, we will get to sing of that deliverance forever.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who hears our cries. And may you see Jesus as the one who delivers us from our suffering."

David wants God to fight for him (Psalm 35:1). He needs God to be like a warrior who brandishes his weapons, rushes into battle, and shouts over the noise, “I am your salvation!” (Psalm 35:2-3).

David’s enemies are vicious. They’ve tried to kill him (Psalm 35:4). They’ve set elaborate traps (Psalm 35:7) and ruthlessly lied and slandered him in courtrooms (Psalm 35:11). They seem to take pleasure in torturing David for no reason (Psalm 35:19a). They enjoy winking at their clever insults (Psalm 35:19b). Most heartbreakingly, David thought these people were his friends. He spent hours praying, days fasting, and nights crying with them (Psalm 35:13-14). Now they love that they can take advantage of David in a moment of vulnerability (Psalm 35:15). 

So David wants God to fight for him. He wants his enemies to be swept away like dust by a breeze (Psalm 35:5). He wants the traps they’ve set for him to spring on them (Psalm 35:8). He wants God to be his attorney and defeat their lies in court (Psalm 35:23). David wants to be vindicated (Psalm 35:24). He wants his reputation publicly restored, while his enemies’ reputations are exposed (Psalm 35:26).

David isn’t asking God to be a vigilante; he’s asking God to set things right. And when God exposes evil for what it is, he knows the whole community will worship God (Psalm 35:27). On that day he’ll bear public witness that no one is like his God (Psalm 35:10).

Where is the Gospel?

It’s not difficult to identify with David. Bullies humiliate us, friends betray us, jokes are made at our expense—and social media publicizes it. In our deepest moments of shame, sometimes people tell us we need to “love our enemies” (Luke 6:27). That’s true and we must do it, but David shows us that we must also passionately pray for God’s justice. 

It’s not wrong to ask God to set things right. It’s not wrong to want guilty parties called to account. That’s not revenge, that’s allowing God to avenge the innocent (Romans 12:19). Praying for our enemies to be exposed and to experience the shame they’ve wrongly caused us is not repaying evil with more evil. it’s asking God to allow his perfect goodness to do battle with evil and win (Romans 12:21).

Ultimately, David was praying for Jesus’ resurrection. The Apostle Paul says that on the cross Jesus defeated every enemy power, authority, and legal accusation. Jesus rising from the dead is a definitive shaming of the forces of malice and injustice that rule the world (Colossians 2:15). 

Jesus now sits at God’s right hand and defends us against our enemies’ accusations of shame. He calls us honored (Psalm 35:23). And Jesus will vindicate us publicly when he announces from the heavens that he is pleased with us, his good and faithful servants (Matthew 25:23). 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who defeats our enemies. And may you see Jesus as the one who shames every accusation, power, and person who comes against those who trust in him."

In him, we find refuge beneath the shadow of his wings.",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening in Psalm 36?

Everywhere Israel looks, no one fears God. Everyone is conceited and no one admits their faults. Every word that comes from their mouths is full of lies and foolishness. Even when they’re at rest, these enemies plot new ways to continue justifying their evil. So David speaks to faithful Israelites and offers them a message of hope from God (Psalm 36:1-4).

While we might expect a message about God’s justice and a coming judgment against evil, in this psalm David invites us to focus on God’s love. 

In a series of opposites, David praises that God’s steadfast love reaches the heavens and his righteousness is grounded in the mountains. God’s faithfulness stretches the skies; his justice is buried in the deep. Both man and beast experience his care and proclaim the pricelessness of God’s love. And both rich and poor find safety in God’s tender arms (Psalm 36:5-7).

Like a lavish host, God prepares a feast and pours out thirst-quenching drinks in the middle of the desert. In God’s love there are fountains of life and enlightenment to those who love him (Psalm 36:8-10). 

God’s life and light reveal to David both the love of God and the fall of the wicked. Confidently, David prays for protection from his enemies in light of God’s priceless love (Psalm 36:11-12).

Where is the Gospel?

Whether in our politicians or our neighbors, it’s easy to see people who are both prosperous and wicked. People who fear God are often rightly concerned when lying, conceited, and wicked people are seated in halls of powers—especially when those same people refuse to sleep until their agenda is legislated (Psalm 36:4).

But for those who fear the Lord, our confidence is in God’s priceless love demonstrated in Jesus. God is love (1 John 4:8). It was from love that Jesus was sent to save us (John 3:16). Jesus’ whole ministry to lead and heal his harassed and helpless people was driven by love (Matthew 9:36). Like a lavish and loving host, Jesus fed 5,000 people (Matthew 14:20-21) and offered a Samaritan woman living water and springs of eternal life (John 4:14). Jesus died because he loves us (Ephesians 5:25). Jesus’ love reached down from heaven, love animated his life on earth, and love motivated his death for us. 

When Jesus returns to throw down evil and make all things new, it will be because of his love (Revelation 21:5). That day will be like a wedding (Revelation 21:2) where Jesus will tenderly wipe away our tears (Revelations 21:4). And like a lavish and loving groom, Jesus will pour out rivers of living water so that we can delight in his love forever (Revelation 21:6). 

If this loving God is for us, who can be against us (Romans 8:31)? The Roman empire and death could not hold our loving Savior. So like David, we can always be confident that God’s love will triumph over evil. Like David, when we trust Jesus he will satisfy us with his thirst-quenching water no matter the desert we find ourselves in.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who loves his people. And may you see Jesus as the one who demonstrates God’s love in his death—and will consummate God’s love when he returns as our Groom.

How priceless is your unfailing love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings. They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights. - Psalm 36: 7-8 NIV"

Psalm 25 is an acrostic about God’s forgiveness. Every verse begins with each letter, in order, of the Hebrew alphabet. This helped the original reader memorize this psalm and its emphasis on the beauty and completeness of God’s mercy. If you can name one sin for every letter of the alphabet, this psalm tells of God’s forgiveness from A-Z.

David begins the psalm with certainty that God will not allow his people to be shamed by their mistakes or sins (Psalm 25:3). He asks God to teach him his ways (Psalm 25:4). Not God’s “way” in the singular, but his “ways” as plural. David doesn’t just expect God to show him a general direction, but to lovingly guide him in all the decisions and moments he’ll face (Psalm 25:10).

Like a mother who can ignore her child’s mistakes and offer loving advice, David asks God to forget his past sins and mercifully guide him (Psalm 25:7). David knows his hope for forgiveness and guidance is not found in his perfect moral record, but in God’s promised allegiance to him despite his sins (Psalm 25:8). 

David goes so far as to say God’s love toward his repentance demands the response of forgiveness (Psalm 25:11)! People who experience God’s forgiveness and personal guidance are not perfect, but they do humbly trust, fear, and look to the Lord (Psalm 25:14-15). 

This trust in God’s goodness and loyal love emboldens David to give God seven directives on how his love should play out in his life. God should turn, relieve, look, see, guard, protect, and deliver David—and anyone in Israel who trusts the Lord (Psalm 25:21-22). 

Where is the Gospel?

David’s hope for forgiveness and guidance is ultimately answered in Jesus. The Apostle John says that Jesus forgives our sins (1 John 2:2). The Apostle Paul says Jesus ends our shame when he pours out his love in our hearts through the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5). The Holy Spirit reminds us of God’s ways and paths (John 14:26). He directs our steps and guides us, just as David prayed (Galatians 5:16).

David demanded seven things from God. The number seven is a nod to God creating the world in seven days. He’s asking God to recreate him and his circumstances, not based on what he deserves, but based on God's grace and mercy (Psalm 25:16-17). Jesus is the one who recreates our hearts (2 Corinthians 5:17). 

We might feel like our whole life from A-Z is nothing but a mess of sin and failure. But in Christ we are new creations—not because we morally performed but because God has determined to make estranged sinners part of his family again (2 Corinthians 5:19).

In that way, Jesus is like a forgiving mother who does not count past mistakes, but in great mercy gathers sinful children back to himself (Matthew 23:37). Everything that David prayed for can also be ours when we humbly trust our sinful selves to Jesus. If we can admit our sins and humbly trust and look towards Jesus, he becomes our complete and total answer to prayer. 

Maybe that’s why Jesus is even described as an acrostic. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the A-Z of God’s life-giving mercy, love, and forgiveness (Revelation 21:6).

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who forgives and guides us. And may you see Jesus as the fullest answer to David’s prayer for deep love despite our sin."

On the cross, since Jesus lifts away all our guilt and sin, there's no reason not to confess everything to him!",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Psalm 32 encourages us to confess our sins so we can experience God’s forgiveness. David says that forgiven people are “blessed” (Psalm 32:1). When we hide nothing from God, God won’t count our sins against us (Psalm 32:2). 

David speaks from personal experience. When he tried to hide his failures from God, it felt like he was dying on the inside (Psalm 32:3). Like a heavy and humid summer heat, David’s unconfessed guilt sapped his energy (Psalm 32:4). But when he acknowledged what he had done, God quickly forgave him (Psalm 32:5b). 

Based on his experience, David turns to his readers and tells us there’s nothing to fear in revealing the darkest parts of ourselves to God (Psalm 32:6a). If we come with open hearts, God won’t take advantage of our vulnerability. Instead he protects us from the waves of guilt we experience (Psalm 32:6b). And he’ll protect us not just with words, but with songs. God will sing songs of deliverance and freedom over us until we’re convinced of his forgiveness (Psalm 32:7).

As king, David instructs his people to follow his example (Psalm 32:8). He doesn’t want them to stay stubborn like a mule (Psalm 32:9). He wants them to confess their sins and approach the God who surrounds them with both songs of freedom and unfailing love (Psalm 32:10). 

David ends by encouraging his people to rejoice and sing songs to the God who responds to their confessed sins with unfailing love, the lifting of guilt, and songs of deliverance (Psalm 32:11). 

Where is the Gospel?

It’s often difficult to name what we’ve done wrong. Confessing our sins, especially to the people we’ve hurt, puts us in an extremely vulnerable position. We’re admitting our responsibility for their pain—and giving the people we’ve wronged the right to cut us out of their lives, punish us, or forgive us. That vulnerability and uncertainty can be powerful enough to prevent us from ever admitting we’re wrong or that we’ve sinned. But bottling up our transgressions comes with its own cost—a crushing sense of guilt, or at the very least, a lot of mental energy trying to forget or justify them.

But like the psalm promises, there is no uncertainty in how God will respond to you. He is willing to forgive and lift away your heavy guilt. We’re told by the Apostle John that when we confess our sins Jesus is faithful to forgive and take away any lingering sense of guilt or dirtiness (1 John 1:9). The author of Hebrews even describes Jesus' cross as the way he “bore” or lifted away the heavy burden of our guilt and sin (Hebrews 9:28). 

Confession makes us vulnerable and can feel like death. But it was precisely when Jesus became vulnerable unto death that our forgiveness and life were secured. 

In Jesus there is no reason to be reluctant about the dark parts of our hearts coming into his light (John 3:21). Jesus’ cross isn’t just good news, it’s our joyful song of his unfailing love and deliverance from our sin and guilt.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who forgives our sins. And may you see Jesus’ cross as God’s song that proves there is no length he won’t go to lift away your guilt and forgive you of your sin."

For Jesus was subdued by his enemies all the way to death, but won victory over them by waiting for God's presence even through the grave.",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

This is a psalm of confidence in God. God is David’s light and salvation, so he’s not afraid (Psalm 27:1). Even though his enemies want to devour, attack, and besiege him, David trusts that God will protect and rescue (Psalm 27:3).

But this psalm is also a plea for God’s presence. David isn’t simply desperate for his enemy’s defeat, he’s desperate for God’s presence (Psalm 27:4a). Like Moses on Mt. Sinai, David wants to experience the full beauty and power of God’s face (Psalm 27:4b). He pleads to “gaze on the beauty of the Lord.” 

David believes that his experience of God’s aesthetic beauty and the worship that creates in his heart is more appropriate than prayers for the destruction of his enemies. After all, God’s presence is his shelter (Psalm 27:5). God’s presence is how he will conquer those enemies (Psalm 27:6).

The most terrifying prospect to David is not losing a strategic military advantage but losing sight of the Lord’s face (Psalm 27:9). So David asks God to teach him to remain in his presence and obey his words (Psalm 27:11). David’s oppressors are slanderous and violent (Psalms 27:12). But David is confident God will bring good from their evil (Psalm 27:13).

David ends by quoting the words God spoke to Joshua: be strong and courageous (Joshua 1:6). But while Joshua was told those words on the eve of battle, David prays these words as he seeks God’s presence (Psalm 27:14). David knows the real battle is in waiting, not the war. It takes courage to wait. But if he does wait, he will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 27:13).

Where is the Gospel?

Waiting on the Lord takes courage, and Jesus was the most courageous person to ever live. Jesus waited more than 30 years until the presence of God fell on him like a dove at his baptism (Luke 3:22). He then waited on the Lord for an additional 40 days—in the presence of his enemy, Satan—before he began his ministry (Mark 1:12). And the rest of his life was marked by waiting on the Lord in prayer (Mark 1:35). 

Jesus saw God’s face unlike anyone before him (John 5:19). Yet tragedies that David was confident wouldn’t happen to people in God’s presence, still happened to Jesus. 

Jesus was turned over to the whims of his enemies and their false accusations (Psalm 27:12). Jesus was surrounded by evil men who wanted to devour him (Psalm 27:2). Jesus’ Father deserted him (Psalm 27:10). God turned his face away from him (Matthew 27:46, Psalm 27:9). And for a time, Jesus did not look on the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 27:13). He waited in the valley of the shadow of death (Psalm 23:4). 

And it was there that God’s presence exalted him (Psalm 27:6). Jesus’ resurrection proves that waiting on God’s presence is never wasted time. Christians are waiting people, some of the last words in Scripture are words that encourage us to wait. Jesus says: “I am coming soon” (Revelation 22:20)! And when we wait for God’s presence like David, we join the story of Jesus on the cross. We wait in hope that God is coming to defeat our enemies with his light. He will save us with his resurrection life.

Psalm 29 is a song about God’s power over all other gods and mighty beings (Psalm 29:1). Every verse (except one) includes God’s personal name—Yahweh. And in most verses it’s used twice. The poetic effect leaves you with no doubt that Yahweh is not only the center of the psalm, but of everything! This glorious God deserves to be worshiped (Psalm 29:2).

David then directs most of his words toward comparing God and his voice to a powerful storm (Psalm 29:3). God’s voice is like a hurricane that lays trees flat (Psalm 29:5). His voice is so powerful that even the tallest mountain in Lebanon shakes when it hears his thunder and sees his lightning (Psalm 29:6-7).

In all, David uses the phrase “voice of the Lord” seven times. It’s a subtle hint to the role God’s voice played at creation (Psalm 29:3, Genesis 1:2-3). But more importantly, it communicates there is nothing in all the earth that doesn’t tremble and bow before the sound of their Creator’s voice. 

That’s why everyone who hears it shouts praise to God (Psalm 29:9). It’s also why David refers to him as the King even over floods (Psalm 29:10). The reference to a flood should remind us of how God warned Noah about another terrifying flood (Genesis 7:4). But more significantly, it reminds us that God’s voice also protected and blessed Noah and his family, eventually giving them peace. 

That’s why David ends his psalm with confidence in how God uses His power.  God uses his voice to strengthen and bless his people with peace (Psalm 29:11).

Where is the Gospel?

David often talks about God as the one who is in control of storms. In part, that’s because Israel often wrongly worshiped the god Baal—the Canaanite god of storms. Psalms like this reminded Israel that Yahweh ruled the storms—and Baal did not. The seemingly unstoppable forces of nature can be calmed with the simple voice of the Lord. 

It’s significant that Jesus calms a storm with his voice too (Luke 8:24). In every Gospel account that records it, Jesus “rebukes” the storm as if it were a demonic god oppressing his people (Mark 4:39). Jesus does what the divine Voice of the Lord did during Noah’s flood—he brings peace and blessing where there was once chaos and fear (Psalm 29:11).

That’s why the disciples are terrified when they ask among themselves on the boat, “Who is this? Even the wind and waves obey him!” (Mark 4:41). There is only one being who can calm storms—the terrifyingly powerful God. 

Jesus is the storm-calming God. But Jesus doesn’t calm hurricanes and flatten waves for the fun of it. His power over the storms points us to the truth that he’s the God who calls our dead hearts to life (Ephesians 2:1, 4-5). More impressive than calming a storm or walking on water is the miracle of raising a sinner from the depths of the dead and seating him at his right hand (Ephesians 2:6). Just as Israel shouted “glory” to God for saving them in the storm, we praise Jesus for the voice that saves us from a watery grave (Psalm 29:9).

Jesus is King of Storms. So bow to him and rejoice! There is no tempest his voice will not calm and there is no grave he can’t empty.

Jesus, our noble king, loves and pursues his valiant wife, the church.",Website,Proverbs Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

In the last chapter of Proverbs, we hear from King Lemuel. More specifically, we hear the wisdom of King Lemuel’s mother. She taught Lemuel what it means to be a noble king and shaped his understanding of what makes a valiant wife. 

While kings often use their power selfishly, Lemuel’s mother taught him that a king should not be ruled by his passions. Kings are not meant for either women or wine but for service. Kings advocate for those who have no voice and provide justice for those who are oppressed. Noble kings also look for noble wives. 

It’s not insignificant that Proverbs begins by depicting Wisdom as a woman and then ends with the wisdom of a wise queen describing a wise woman. Moving from an allegorical woman to a flesh-and-blood wife shows us that wisdom is not simply a mental pursuit, but a concrete virtue. This valiant wife is a role model. Women should want to be like her, men should want to marry her, and all seekers of wisdom should want to incarnate her wisdom in their own life.  

This woman is a hero to her husband, to her community, and to her children. Unlike so much ancient and modern literature, there’s no preoccupation with her body or her curves. There is no fencing a wife’s responsibilities to silence and domesticity. Instead, she’s an entrepreneur, a teacher, and a philanthropist. Scholars point out that Proverbs 31 has more in common with Israel’s heroic hymns than any other genre. 

While hidden to us in English, the poem is filled with words and images normally reserved for military campaigns. This woman “stretches out her arm to the … spindle” just like we’re told God’s outstretched arms saved Israel from Egypt. This valiant queen in the everyday tasks of providing clothes and making money is God’s instrument for good and justice in the world.

Where is the Gospel?

Lemuel’s mother hoped that her son would be a selfless king and that he would marry the valiant queen she described. If we are single we can worry we’re not the “marriage material” described by Lemuel. If we are married, we have lots of evidence that shows how we fall short of Proverbs 31’s standards. But the apostle Paul tells us that both Lemuel’s mother’s wish and our feelings of inadequacy are best resolved in Jesus’ relationship to his Church. 

Paul tells husbands that the purpose of marriage is to depict and symbolize Jesus’ love and pursuit of his valiant wife, his Church. Like the king described by Lemuel’s mother, Jesus did not come to be served with wine or women, but to serve and give his life for his bride. 

And Jesus serves his bride by transforming her into the bride she is meant to be. Jesus erases the evidence of how she falls short and makes her valiant and wise. When we say “I do” to Jesus, he presents us as strong, wise, honest, compassionate, and pure. He transforms us to consider not just our own family, but also the poor. Jesus strengthens us to stretch out our hands to the hard work of justice and mercy until his Kingdom comes again. While we often fall far short, like a good husband Jesus is forgiving of what we’ve done. And he is devoted to making us wise kings and queens in his Kingdom. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is a selfless King. And may you see Jesus as the faithful husband who pursues and makes his bride wise and strong."

Psalm 11 opens with a hypothetical question: “In the Lord I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, ‘Flee like a bird to your mountain’” (Psalm 11:1). The question is meant to show that the threats of ruin coming for David are pointless when he considers God is his refuge. 

The rest of the psalm shows us why David trusts in God. David trusts God because of where God is, who God is, and what God will do. 

First, David says he doesn’t need to fear the wicked because of where God resides (Psalm 11:4a). David appeals to the two extremes of God’s presence. God is near him and his people in the temple. But God is also high above everything, ruling from his throne in heaven (Psalm 11:4b).

Second, David considers who God is. God is good and opposes evil (Psalm 11:5). 

Third, David takes refuge in God because of what God will do. God will punish the wicked with fiery coals and sulfur (Psalm 11:6). And God will also bring an ultimate blessing to the righteous (Psalm 11:7). That ultimate blessing for the righteous isn’t simply protection, but the satisfying presence of God himself. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus perfectly reveals to us where God is, who God is, and what God will do. 

Where is God? God is with us (Matthew 1:23)! The God who rules from his throne in heaven came in the temple of Jesus (John 2:21). And after rising from the grave, Jesus ascended back to his throne in heaven and sent his Holy Spirit (John 14:16). Because of Jesus, God isn’t just with us, he is in us!

Who is God? Well, Jesus is for good and against the wicked—and he proved this on the cross. In his death, Jesus shows us how much he hates wickedness. He hates it so much that he was willing to suffer and die to conquer it. He also loves righteousness so much that he gives us his own goodness (2 Corinthians 5:21). 

Finally, what will God do? Jesus taught that a final day of judgment is still coming for the wicked. In fact, he will be the one bringing the fire (2 Thessalonians 1:7-8). But all who take refuge in Jesus will see God’s face (Revelation 22:4). They will experience the satisfying intimacy of seeing the beautiful face of Jesus (2 Corinthians 4:6). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see God as a refuge because of where he is, who he is, and what he does. And may you see Jesus as the one who rules yet comes near, who died to conquer wickedness, and who is returning to show us his beautiful face! "

Jesus' resurrection gives us hope that everything done in Christ will last forever.",Website,Proverbs Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Work is a part of God’s wise design for the universe. In the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam and Eve jobs (Genesis 1:28). In their work to keep the garden and subdue the earth, they were perfectly fulfilled. It wasn’t until our first parents rejected God’s wisdom that work became a source of toil and discomfort, with displeasure and laziness entering the picture (Genesis 3:17). 

Laziness is foolishness incarnated. It is the ultimate rejection of God’s wisdom for the world because we are designed to work for God’s glory. Some of the most sarcastic and biting remarks in the book of Proverbs are reserved for those who are able to work but unwilling to do so. 

“As a door turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed” (Proverbs 26:14). 

“The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth” (Proverbs 19:24; 26:15). 

“As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so are sluggards to those who send them” (Proverbs 10:26). 

Lazy people are not only comical in their commitment to doing nothing, they’re an irritant to those forced to be near them. Some are so committed to laziness they’ll invent ridiculous reasons to avoid working. “The sluggard says, ‘There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the public square!’” (Proverbs 22:13). 

The wisdom of the book of Proverbs is that hard work is not only the way the world works but that it pays off. Proverbs 14:4 says “Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but from the strength of an ox come abundant harvests.” Owning oxen comes with a lot of dirty work in the stable. But without that effort, you’ll never see a harvest. Only those with “diligent hands will rule …” (Prov. 12:24). The apostle Paul says simply, “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat” (2 Thessalonians 3:10). 

Where is the Gospel?

God made us to work. When God placed Adam and Eve in the garden, only some of the earth was cultivated. They were told to exercise dominion, fill the earth, and subdue it. Adam and Eve’s work in agriculture, city-building, irrigation, and culture would be the way God’s image, his name, and his glory spread throughout the earth (Genesis 1:27). In Eden, all work was sacred. Milking the cows mattered. And in Jesus, that happens again.

Through Jesus’ death and resurrection, he makes us a “kingdom of priests” once again. We are part of a kingdom of sacred workers whose every effort matters; where every keystroke and line of code advances God’s glory. The promise of laziness is that if we don’t try, we won’t be disappointed. But because Jesus rose from the dead we can know that none of our efforts will be frustrated because all efforts are eternal.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who made you to work hard. And may you see Jesus, who by his resurrection frees you from the temptation and the promise of laziness."

The almighty God becomes human in Jesus!",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What's Happening? 

The psalm begins and ends with a grand claim about God. In every square inch of creation we can find the beauty, glory, and might of God's name (Psalm 8:1). God is intimately involved in creating, sustaining, and moving every part of creation.

And yet, in the next sentence, we see a tension between God's glorious power that exists high above the heavens, and mankind's frail weakness that exists far below the stars and moon here on earth (Psalm 8:3).

The second verse doubles down on this tension by saying that God's strength can be exercised through something as small and powerless as the coos and babblings that come out of a baby's mouth (Psalm 8:2). 

David even says, ""What is mankind that you are mindful of them?"" (Psalm 8:4). In poetic language, David is asking, ""Why does God care about us?"" 

David meditates on Genesis 1:26 and remembers when God created humanity in his image, crowning them with glory and honor (Psalm 8:5). Here is another great tension. The King of all the earth, who rules above the heavens, has made his own creatures kings. And like all kings, he gave them territory and authority (Genesis 1:28). David repeats God's words spoken to Adam in the Garden of Eden, that he would rule over every living thing (Psalm 8:6). 

All this meditation on our great God's care for frail earthly humans leads David to praise God. 

Where is the Gospel? 

When the New Testament quotes this psalm, it doesn't refer to the outlandish gap between heaven and earth, or God and man. It talks about heaven coming to earth and God becoming man in the person of Jesus (Hebrews 2:6). 

God, who made us in his image, was made into our image. God was not only mindful of us, but became like us. He who is God's strength itself became a literal baby (Matthew 1:23). 

Hebrews 2:9 even quotes this psalm and says it's about Jesus: ""But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone."" 

The God who lives forever in glory above the heavens tasted death for those who were sure to die here on the earth. In Jesus we see how an eternal God who lives forever cares for frail humans who die. The everlasting God died in our frail image to give us eternal life. 

Jesus laid his glory, honor, and crown in the dust so we could be exalted and lifted up! Surely we can join David in this psalm and say with wonder in our voices, ""What is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you die for them?"" 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has all power and might, yet loves us and cares for us. And may you see Jesus as the one who came down from heaven to show us his care in the greatest possible way—by tasting death on our behalf."

This is a prayer of confidence and trust in God. David knows God will protect him (Psalm 16:1). He knows everything good in his life has already come from him, and he trusts that will be true in the future as well (Psalm 16:2). 

So David refuses to make offerings to other gods (Psalm 16:4b). He warns his people that anyone who goes after other gods will only increase their sorrow (16:4a). But if they remain faithful to the Lord, God will preserve them in their land and watch over them (Psalm 16:6). 

David’s confidence is in the one true God alone. He counts on God like a son counts on an inheritance—God is his portion (Psalm 16:5). God himself is David’s gift and inheritance (Psalm 16:8). God instructs, guides, and leads David in his innermost being (Psalm 16:7). This reality leads him to gladness and he rejoices in all of his being (Psalm 16:9a). 

David’s whole body is in God’s hands (Psalm 16:9b). Remarkably, he says that God will not abandon him to Sheol—the grave (Psalm 16:10a). God will save him from death and decay, and will reveal to him the path of life (16:10b-11a). When David trusts God alone, he knows God himself will be his inheritance. At God’s right hand he will find fullness of joy and eternal pleasure (16:11b).  

Where is the Gospel?

This is such an important psalm for three reasons. 

First, the Apostle Peter quotes this psalm in his first Gospel message (Acts 2:25). God allowed David to see prophetically what would happen to one of his descendants, Jesus (Acts 2:30-31a). Jesus “was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay” (Acts 2:31b). 

Jesus now sits at God’s right hand (Acts 2:33a) and has given all who believe in him a new inheritance—himself in the person of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:33b). 

And that’s the second reason we need this psalm. It promises that we will share eternity with God himself (Revelation 21:3). Heaven is not simply a place but an experience of God’s presence. Because of Jesus we will find fullness of joy and eternal pleasure at God’s right hand. When we trust Jesus, all of who God is becomes ours (Ephesians 1:3). 

Third and finally, we need prayers of confidence and trust like this one. When you start to feel helpless, or question what will bring you ultimate joy, pleasure, and contentment, pray this prayer. Trust that Jesus, the son of David, has been rescued from the grave, has given you himself in the Holy Spirit, and is coming back to bring you to himself. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God whose presence is the greatest joy and pleasure we could ever inherit. And may you see Jesus as the one who defeated the grave in order to give us this greatest gift of all—his very self. "

Jesus would one day be betrayed and surrounded by enemies. But the good news is that through Jesus' death, David's prayer comes true! Because of Jesus we can be comforted and rescued.",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What's Happening? 

Psalm 3 was written during the events described in 2 Samuel 15-18. One of David's sons, Absalom, formed a secret takeover of his father's throne (2 Samuel 15:14). David went into hiding and nearly all the people of Israel were against him. 

Because of these horrible events, David records a lament. His enemies seem incalculable (2 Samuel 15:12). Beyond their sheer number, they are making David question his relationship with God and his salvation (Psalm 3:2), even though God promised one of his descendants would sit on his throne (2 Samuel 7:12).

For David, Israel's relationship with God was on the line. The hope of a perfect future king was also on the line. 

But it is not all lament. David reminds himself that when his enemies surround him, God will protect him like a 360-degree shield (Psalm 3:3a). Even when his kingly glory is cast aside and ruined, he still has more glory than any other king because he is with God (Psalm 3:3b).

His faith in God rests on one simple truth: David woke up this morning (Psalm 3:5). God kept him safe through the unconsciousness of sleep. If God can sustain him when he is most vulnerable, there is nothing else to fear (Psalm 3:6).

The realization that all his help comes from God causes David to cry out for help from the only one who is able (Psalm 3:7). After all, salvation is the sole property of God alone (Psalm 3:8). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus saw Israel, his chosen people, in a similar situation as his chosen servant David was in when he wrote this psalm (Luke 19:43). Only this time, when his servant was surrounded by their enemies, they would not be saved (Luke 19:44). Like all of us, they sought to rule themselves and had not made peace with God (Luke 19:42). 

God was going to punish Israel again with the enemies that surrounded her—the Roman Empire (Matthew 24:2). They would destroy Israel's temple as a physical result of their spiritual rebellion. But Jesus showed a way out of their inevitable destruction through his cross. 

Jesus experienced in full what David experienced in part. The earthly religious rulers of his day, like Absalom, conspired against Jesus (Matthew 12:14). When their conspiracy reached its height, Jesus was surrounded by many foes at the Garden of Gethsemane, in his many sham trials, and ultimately at the cross (Matthew 27:39). His enemies even echo the taunts of David's opponents that God would not save him (Matthew 27:43).

But instead of seeing God as a shield around him like David, Jesus only spoke of God removing his protection (Matthew 27:46). Ultimately, when Jesus laid down to sleep, it was the sleep of death. Jesus was destroyed by his enemies to provide the deliverance David prayed for. 

While the physical temple in Israel was still destroyed by the Romans, now all nations can cry out to Jesus for deliverance from the eternal sleep of death (John 2:19). We know this because, as God sustained David through a night of sleep, he also sustained Jesus through death. Jesus rose from the dead to prove that those who put their trust in him for deliverance, the final King of kings, will sustain them into eternal life. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who sustains us while we sleep. And may you see Jesus as the King who rose from the dead to provide eternal deliverance to all who call out to him. "

This psalm is a plea for deliverance (Psalm 17:1). David calls out for God to save him from a wicked attack (Psalm 17:9).

David believes God should save him because of his innocence. He reminds God that he has been tested and his heart, lips, and actions are without fault (Psalm 17:3). 

It’s significant that David starts with his heart and then moves to outward actions. He is saying that even his intentions, motivations, and affections are perfectly in line (Psalm 17:5). 

David prays like this because he knows God will always vindicate what is right (Psalm 17:2). God always upholds justice for those who seek him. He will always make righteousness win in the end (Psalm 17:7). 

However, that doesn’t always look true in our world. It sure didn’t appear true in David’s time either. There are arrogant, wicked men who seek to wrongly devour David like a lion (Psalm 17:12). When the wicked are rich, it is easy to feel like David’s innocence is worthless.

But David makes an important distinction between himself and the wicked. He says that the wicked’s portion is in this life (Psalm 17:14). They are satisfied with the meager benefits this world can offer—benefits that will be gone when they die (Psalm 17:14c).  

David, on the other hand, has a more glorious portion waiting for him. He will behold the face of God (Psalm 17:15a). He will look at the perfect character, righteousness, and justice of God and his likeness will bring perfect satisfaction (Psalm 17:15b). 

This is what David hopes to see when he awakes. He looks forward to a day beyond the grave, when he will be resurrected into the presence of God. 

Where is the Gospel?

Christians today are also saved by our innocence. However, this innocence doesn’t come from us; it comes from Jesus. Jesus, far more so than David, was truly innocent before God in every way—in his heart, lips, and actions. What was true of David’s innocence in this one instance, is true of Jesus eternally. 

But when wicked men sought to devour him like a lion, Jesus did not appeal to his own innocence so that God would rescue him (Matthew 26:53). Unlike David, Jesus didn’t even defend his own innocence when questioned by those who were sending him to death (Matthew 27:12). Instead, innocent Jesus was called guilty so that we who are guilty can be called innocent (2 Corinthians 5:21). 

When we call out to God and trust that Jesus’ innocence is available to us, we will not only be saved from our enemies (like David), but we will also see God’s face (Revelation 22:4). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who vindicates the innocent. And may you see Jesus as the innocent one who died so that even the guilty can experience his salvation and see his face. "

Solomon is in the middle of ten lectures to his son. The first five lectures encourage Solomon’s son to choose wisdom and avoid evil. Solomon’s last five lectures personify that struggle as a choice between joining himself to Lady Wisdom or having an affair with Madame Folly. 

On one level, it’s a simple lesson about the danger of adultery. Sleeping with another man’s wife is a decision you will pay for the rest of your life. Solomon compares it to carrying fire under your clothes or walking on coals; he warns you can’t help but get burned (Proverbs 6:27-28). Entering into an affair is like an animal walking into a trap (Proverbs 7:22-23). Madame Folly’s bait is passion, secrecy, and the promise of no consequences. If the son sees only the bait, the hook will never let him escape.is slaughter will come (Proverbs 9:18). 

But if Solomon’s son wants to avoid destruction, he must choose Lady Wisdom as the only object of his affection. He must write her words on his heart, and perhaps even more intimately, he needs to call wisdom his “sister” (Proverbs 7:2-4). If he joins himself to Lady Wisdom, he avoids slaughter and gains her as his advisor as he rules nations, gains wealth, and lives a long life (Proverbs 8:14-16, 8:38). 

On another level these passages are not about the pursuit or avoidance of sex, but about the pursuit of wisdom itself. Solomon asks his son to imagine that he’s standing at a fork in the road. At the crossroads, two women are calling for him (Proverbs 7:25; 8:2). In many ways they seem similar: both have made sacrifices, both offer wine and food, and both offer rewards for turning into their home. One woman tells him to trust God (Proverbs 9:10), and the other tells him, like the serpent, to trust his desires (Proverbs 9:17). 

Solomon encourages his son to choose the wisdom that was with God when he formed the world (Proverbs 8:22-36). And he’s warning his son to reject the wisdom that brought death and evil into God’s world. 

Where is the Gospel?

Solomon compares his lectures to God’s law. He tells his son that if he “write[s] them on the tablet of [his] heart” and they are the “apple of his eye,” he will be protected from the seduction of evil and will experience the blessings of God (Proverbs 7:2-3). From history, we know that Solomon’s sons did not follow his father’s instructions. Israel’s hearts, hardened to wisdom, were seduced to idolatry, adultery, and eventually exile at Babylon’s hands.

During that exile, the prophet Ezekiel uses the language of Proverbs, saying God will give Israel a new spirit, remove their hearts of stone, and give them hearts that will listen to God’s wisdom (Ezekiel 11:19, 36:26). Ezekiel promises that Solomon’s hopes will one day come true. And they do—in Jesus. Jesus fills us with His Spirit and writes his laws on our hearts (John 14:26). 

This is good news because we are faced with the same choice Solomon’s son was warned about. We’re pulled in one direction by our desires and in another direction by God’s word. It’s only Jesus’ Spirit of wisdom written on our hearts that can do battle with Satan’s temptations and the Madame’s folly. If you are tired of losing that battle between God’s word and your desires, be encouraged! By Jesus’ power, you can walk by the Spirit and say no to the desires of your body (Galatians 5:16-17). By Jesus’ power, Lady Wisdom becomes your sister. His wisdom will lead and guide you into eternal life with him. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who writes wisdom on our hearts. And may you see Jesus as the wisdom of Solomon by whom we say no to temptation, and say yes to God’s life."

Jesus' love and God’s glory come to our aid whenever we call to him.",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

This psalm is an all-out plea for grace. David believes he is suffering because God is disciplining him (Psalm 6:1). Every night he cries so much that his pillow is wet with tears (Psalm 6:6). He wants God to rescue him from the problem at hand (Psalm 6:4). So David appeals to God’s steadfast love (Psalm 6:4).

God’s steadfast love is not just his kind feelings toward a person. Steadfast love refers to God’s covenant love. It is a loyal love based on promises that have been made—like the love between a husband and wife. 

If David dies, he believes God’s steadfast love is on the line in his turmoil. That is because part of the promises God made to Israel were tied up in his well being (2 Samuel 7:12). One of David’s descendants would sit on Israel’s throne forever (2 Samuel 7:16). If God doesn’t act, it would seem as though his promises will go unfulfilled. 

So, David appeals to the praise God is due. If David is given over to death, he will not be able to praise God (Psalm 6:5).

David issues a warning to everyone seeking to harm him (Psalm 6:8). He tells them to flee from his presence because they will be greatly troubled and put to shame at any moment. God, in his mercy, has heard David’s prayer (Psalm 6:9). 

This renewed confidence most likely did not come from a miraculous physical event, but a spiritual one. David’s tormented soul is comforted because God has heard his prayer and will soon come to save him (Psalm 6:10). This isn’t David just thinking happy thoughts, but a miraculous work of God that gives hope to David’s hopeless heart. 

Where is the Gospel? 

When things go bad it’s easy to think God is punishing us. Our experience feels like proof that God is against us and hopelessness is our only option. But David doesn't just cry out, “How long, O, Lord?” He says his suffering is a challenge to God’s love and glory, and that God must address it. Like David we should also remind God that his love and his glory are on the line in our suffering. While this Psalm doesn’t record an answer to David’s prayer, ultimately David’s prayer is answered in Jesus. 

Jesus used these words of David to describe his own inner anguish when he went to the cross (John 12:27). But unlike David, he does not ask God to deliver his life. Instead, he willingly goes to the cross out of love (John 3:16). And unlike David, who says going to the grave will rob God of glory, Jesus says that dying on the cross will glorify his name (John 12:28). 

When Jesus went to the cross he actually did bear the wrath of God that David felt like he was bearing. But here we see what God is willing to do for the sake of his steadfast love. He is willing to go to the grave. 

But death would not squelch all praise of God as David feared (Psalm 6:5). Instead, because Jesus went to the grave and rose again, when he returns every knee will bow and give praise to God (Philippians 2:10). 

We can appeal to God’s steadfast love when we suffer because he always answers back with the Gospel. Like David, we can faithfully and boldly ask God to be merciful, to act, to save us because he has done it completely in Jesus. He has saved us from wrath and rescued us from the ultimate agony of the grave. Because Jesus was raised we can say with David, “The Lord has heard my cry for mercy” (Psalm 6:9). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is loving and glorious. And may you see Jesus as the one who demonstrates God’s love and glory through his own suffering, so that we can be comforted in ours."

This psalm opens with a question about who can dwell with God (Psalm 15:1). The rest of the psalm is David’s answer to his own question.

People who can enter God’s presence are righteous (Psalm 15:2a), honest (Psalm 15:2b),  clean tongued (Psalm 15:3a), loving (Psalm 15:3b), and caring (Psalm 15:3c). They hate evil (Psalm 15:4a) and fear God (Psalm 15:4b). People who experience God’s presence have integrity (Psalm 15:4c), are generous (Psalm 15:5a), and protect the innocent (Psalm 15:5b).

In short, the people who can come close to God are those who genuinely serve him. God is looking for people who keep his law, reflect his character, and pursue holiness. 

This prayer was most likely prayed as Israelites made pilgrimages to the temple during certain holy days (Deuteronomy 16:16). That’s why David talks about sojourning in God’s tent and dwelling on his holy hill (Psalm 15:1). And as they journey, this psalm encourages the pilgrims to remember that only whole-hearted servants of God can access him. 

The hope is that this song will lead them to repentance. If there is evil within them, they can make it right before getting to the temple and make atonement for it through sacrifice once they arrive.   

The final verse of the psalm says those who keep the characteristics outlined earlier will never be moved (Psalm 15:5c). It’s an implicit reminder that those who genuinely serve him will never be moved from the land of Israel while those who don’t follow his law will be re

moved

 (Leviticus 26:5,33). 

Where is the Gospel?

This psalm presents a question that every person on earth should ask: will I live with God forever? Being in God’s presence isn’t simply a spiritual experience, but the best possible reality we can live in. The next psalm says that in God’s “presence there is fullness of joy” and at his “right hand are pleasures forevermore” (Psalm 16:11, ESV). 

So, like the pilgrims who first heard this psalm, we should also use this psalm to reflect on the state of our own hearts. Do we walk blamelessly, speak truthfully, refrain from gossip and insults, hate evil, and love well? Do we meet the qualifications laid out in Psalm 15 that will allow us to draw near to God? 

Well, the psalm just before this one gives us our answer: “There is no one who does good” (Psalm 14:1). Like the Apostle Paul says, we have fallen short of the glorious character of God and don’t deserve to be near him (Romans 3:23). 

But that’s where our hope also lies. When we see how far we fall short and confess that to God, Jesus offers to give us his perfections and qualifications.

Jesus is the Lord in the tabernacle. He is the God who dwells on heaven’s holy hill. He perfectly upheld all ten of this psalm’s qualifications. Jesus has the authority to determine who worships in his presence. 

But Jesus, who was once perfectly in God’s presence, left it. In turn, God’s presence abandoned him. He was cast outside the city, away from the holy hill, to die on a cross (Hebrews 13:12). But he died in our place. Jesus used his authority to take responsibility for the ways we fall short. In doing so he removed the punishment that separates sinners like us from God’s presence (Ephesians 2:13). 

Anyone who trusts in Jesus will be treated as if they are Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:21). Like Jesus we will rise from the dead—and one day the last line of Psalm 15 will be true for us. We will dwell with God forever (Revelation 21:3). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God whose presence is our greatest treasure. And may you see Jesus as the one who brings us into God’s presence. "

All of us can be rescued from our enemies when we take refuge in Jesus.",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

Throughout the song, David pictures himself entering God’s presence in the tabernacle. In the morning he prepares a sacrifice (Psalm 5:3). Then he enters the tabernacle and bows before God (Psalm 5:7). Finally, David says that all who take refuge in God will be surrounded by his presence just as the walls of the tabernacle surrounded David (Psalm 5:12). 

David wants others to experience with him the joy and gladness that comes with being near God’s presence (Psalm 5:11). This experience is only for those who, like David, come to God with reverence and fear. They aren’t allowed near God because they deserve it, but because of God’s great love for them (Psalm 5:7a). 

But David speaks differently about the wicked in this Psalm. They don’t bow in humility before God. Instead, they try to proudly stand in his presence (Psalm 5:5). They don’t use their lips to honor God, but lie and defraud others (Psalm 5:6). So, instead of receiving God’s love, David says they receive his hate (Psalm 5:5b). Instead of being allowed near God, they are excluded from his presence (Psalm 5:10). 

The wicked’s experience of God’s presence is the exact opposite of the righteous. The righteous are brought in. The wicked are cast out. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus picks up this language and imagery in several of his parables (Matthew 7:23). Multiple times, Jesus says that those not in his presence will be cast into outer darkness where there will be “weeping and gnashing of teeth” (Matthew 8:12; see also 13:42, 22:13, 24:51, 25:30; Luke 13:28). 

Jesus equates himself with the presence David longed for in our psalm (Matthew 11:27). Being with Jesus is being with the presence of God (John 14:9). The ultimate punishment for wickedness is being separated from Jesus (2 Thessalonians 1:9). 

When we read these passages, we might wonder if we will be brought in or cast out of Jesus’ presence. After all, we’ve been proud, told lies, and are guilty like the wicked people David describes in Psalm 5. Nevertheless, even though we all deserve to be cast out from Jesus’ presence, we instead are brought into it. 

This is because Jesus went through a similar journey into God’s presence that David describes in the psalm. David offered an animal sacrifice to gain entry into the tabernacle for himself. Jesus offered the sacrifice of his own body to earn entry into God’s presence for others (Hebrews 10:19). David bowed down in humility before God. Jesus bowed lower, in deeper humility, into the mouth of the grave (Phliippians 2:8). 

And when Jesus died, the barrier that separated God’s presence in the tabernacle from the rest of the world was torn down (Matthew 27:51). Now, all those who take refuge in Jesus can come near to his presence and sing for joy (Psalm 5:11). 

See For Yourself

I pray the Holy Spirit gives you eyes to see the God whose presence brings joy and protection to those who reverently draw near. And may you see Jesus as the one who took our evil so that we can be brought into the greatest good—his presence. "

As David is pursued by his enemies, he calls out to God for help (Psalm 7:2). 

Using courtroom language, David tells God that he is innocent (Psalm 7:3). David's so confident in his innocence that he even names his own punishment (Psalm 7:5)!

In light of his innocence David asks God to pronounce justice against his enemies (Psalm 7:6). This is not an angry request for God to pick on people David doesn't like. David is simply affirming something within God's character—that he is a good and just judge (Psalm 7:8). 

God judges the whole earth and saves the ""upright in heart"" (Psalm 7:10). However, he brings ""the violence of the wicked"" to an end (Psalm 7:9a). God tests the minds and hearts of people and returns their mischief on their own heads (Psalm 7:16). The wicked pit that David's enemies dug out for him will be the same trap into which they fall (Psalm 7:15). 

The psalm ends with David giving thanks to God, the judge, because of his righteousness (7:17). God is good, perfect, just, equitable, and always right. Everyone who sees him as a judge will worship him, because who wouldn't want a perfect ruler, an impartial judge, and a blameless lawmaker? 

Where is the Gospel? 

In Jesus we can make the same claim as David. We are innocent. Satan, our own conscience, and others often accuse us, but we can have confidence we have been declared innocent before God by faith in Jesus (Romans 8:1).

Like David we can boldly claim our innocence before this great judge. Jesus was innocent, full of integrity, and completely righteous. Yet, he died for us. Jesus' death not only gave us his innocence but also his righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21). In a way, Jesus does the opposite of what David prayed for. David asks to be saved from his enemies because of his innocence, but Jesus leverages his innocence to save his enemies. 

Since we are innocent before God the judge, we can also ask him to act against wickedness as David did. We can ask him to silence the mouth of Satan, our accuser (James 4:7). We can plead with him to silence the lies of our self-condemning conscience (Hebrews 9;14). And we can beg him, as a good judge, to turn people's wickedness against them (Galatians 1:9). 

David gives thanks to God because of his righteousness. He sings praises because God is right to call him innocent and bring his enemies to account (Psalm 7:17). We can do the same. We can worship God because of his goodness in judging the wicked as guilty, while judging us as innocent because of Jesus. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see God as the perfect and impartial judge over the whole world. And may you see Jesus who was judged for us so that we can live with clean hands before God."

Psalm 19 is about how God reveals his existence, character, will, and plan to all humanity. 

David first reflects on God’s self-revelation in the sky and stars (Psalm 19:1). Every millisecond of their existence proclaims their creation by a powerful God with an eye for beauty (Psalm 19:2). Their message about God goes to every corner of the earth (Psalm 19:4a). 

David then bursts into a song of thankfulness for God’s law (Psalm 19:7). God has not left the duty of revealing who he is to the stars. He takes that responsibility on himself. God speaks to the world in a way stars never could (Psalm 19:3). Using human words, God reveals himself in his Law. 

No wonder David rejoices over the Law (Psalm 19:8). It is in the Law that he can meet God! That is why David says the Law is more precious than gold and sweeter than honey (Psalm 19:10). It is the self-revealing voice of God. 

There is one more reason David is thankful for God’s self-revelation in the Law. It teaches him how to live the way God wants him to. The Law offers warnings that keep him from harm and commands that lead to reward (19:11). 

Finally, David asks God for forgiveness for the sins in his heart he can’t perceive and for restraint against the more blatant sins he tries to fight (Psalm 19:12-13a). His goal is to be blameless, like the God who reveals himself to him (Psalm 19:13b). 

Where is the Gospel?

The New Testament picks up on the idea that creation reveals God to the world. God’s existence and power are clearly shown in the cosmos (Romans 1:20). But that self-revelation means that everyone on earth is also responsible for how they’ve responded to the God who reveals himself in nature (Romans 1:18). 

Most of us act as if God does not exist. We live godless lives. We assume we’re our own gods and live however we choose (Romans 1:22-23). And in God’s justice he lets us pursue our own destruction (Romans 1:18).

Like David, we need to cry out for forgiveness for the times when we fall short of God’s revealed character in creation and in his Law. But the good news: God has answered that cry for forgiveness in his greatest act of self-revelation. 

More than creation and more than the Law, Jesus is the full and final self-revelation of God (Hebrews 1:3). Jesus is God himself in the flesh. If we want to know what God is like, we need look no further than Jesus, who is the “image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15). In him, “God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell” (Colossians 1:19). 

And this fullness of God’s self-revelation died on the cross for both our secret and blatant sins. And because of that sacrifice, we who treated the gold of God’s revelation as if it were worthless and the honey of God’s Law as if it were tasteless, get to receive a forgiveness we do not deserve. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who graciously reveals himself in creation and in his law. And may you see Jesus as the full and final self-revelation of God, who shows us how loving, merciful, and beautiful he is in his death and resurrection. "

Jesus is now ruling and frustrating the plans of all our enemies.",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

Psalm 2 is about God’s Kingdom.

God promised David, the king of Israel, that one of his descendants would sit on his throne forever (2 Samuel 7:16). This would be God’s King, ruling God’s Kingdom. This would be God’s Anointed One, which is the same word translated as “Messiah” in the Old Testament and “Christ” in the New Testament. 

But the opponents described in this psalm want nothing to do with this kingdom (Psalm 2:1). Rival nations and internal rebellions try to gain authority over God and his chosen people (Psalm 2:2). They do not want to submit to Israel’s God, much less to God’s anointed one—Israel’s king (Psalm 2:3).  

But the psalmist says that all of this plotting is in vain. No matter how they try to throw off God’s rule, they will fail because God is the Lord of the whole earth. In fact, thinking a human can overthrow God is so comical that God laughs at those who try (Psalm 2:4).

It’s laughable because God has already decided who will reign as King (Psalm 2:6). This King will not only rule over Israel, but the whole earth (Psalm 2:8). This promised Messiah will be called his Son (Psalm 2:7). He will  judge the nations with a rod of iron and establish justice across the whole earth (Psalm 2:9). 

God’s King will come. It will happen. So instead of trying to rebel or build our own kingdom, there is only one response. The kings and rulers of the earth must “Kiss the Son” (Psalm 2:12a). Picture a person bending the knee and kissing the king’s ring. It is a sign of allegiance. 

God rules the universe and his King will rule forever. Rebellion against this King is laughable and leads to destruction (Psalm 2:12b). But allegiance to this King leads to blessing and safety (Psalm 2:12c). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The Good News is that Jesus is this promised King. 

God reveals this truth early on in Jesus’ ministry by quoting this psalm at Jesus’ baptism (Matthew 3:17).  God tells everyone that the promises of Psalm 2 are fulfilled in Jesus. The nations’ plots will not prevail. 

For a moment, it looked as if the plots of humans and governments would prevail even over Jesus (Matthew 27:1). He was wrongly arrested, falsely accused, and unjustly executed on a cross. Nevertheless, even these plans are laughable compared to the power of God (Colossians 2:15). 

Jesus rose from the dead and took the throne promised in Psalm 2 (Ephesians 1:20). This is not an earthly throne that is limited and could perish. Jesus’ throne is in heaven—over all and eternal (Ephesians 1:21). 

But the nations still rage against God. Countries and governments still chase after power at the expense of the weak and marginalized (Matthew 24:7). But Jesus is still King. And as King, he is coming soon to judge wicked rulers and bring refuge to the oppressed. 

We have a choice—to trust in the kingdoms of this world or to give our allegiance to King Jesus. And if we bend our knee to Jesus, we will find refuge in him.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who is in control of all when everything seems out of control. And may you see Jesus as the promised Son who sits on the throne of heaven, bringing mercy and justice to the ends of the earth. "

This psalm introduces us to someone called “the fool.” He says in his heart, “There is no God” (Psalm 14:1). 

Fools disregard God. This is most likely not the same thing as atheism—the belief that God simply does not exist. Instead, fools live, think, judge, and make decisions as if God does not have any real effect on the world. 

This secret, inward conviction against God has consequences. The fool becomes corrupt and is unable to do anything good (Psalm 14:3). Fools exploit the poor and needy for their own gain, consuming them like pieces of bread (Psalm 14:4). When God looks down from heaven, he concludes that every person is like this. No one is left on earth who does good, not even one (Psalm 14:3). 

David is exaggerating. He doesn’t include himself or the righteous who are oppressed (Psalm 14:5-6). But the message is clear: the world is full of sinful fools, and if we’re honest that often includes you and me. 

David tells the fools who act like God has no effect on the world that they should be terrified (Psalm 14:5). God is very real. And David encourages the wise who know God exists that the Lord will be their refuge (Psalm 14:6). He will restore what was taken from them and bring them into his protective presence (Psalm 14:7). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Paul, in his letter to the Romans, addresses the same fools David does, and even quotes this psalm directly. Pauls says “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one” (Romans 3:10-12). 

In our “wisdom” we claimed God had no real effect on the world—and it earned us the title of “fool” (Romans 1:22). In a world that consistently rejects God, you can see for yourself the type of corruption, oppression, and exploitation that exists. And we’re foolish to think we’re not complicit in those systems.

If we want to escape the corrupt cycles of life on earth, if we want to be forgiven for the ways we’ve contributed to oppression, then we need to believe that God exists (Hebrews 11:6). We need to trust that God is real. And if we confess with our mouths that Jesus is God we will not only be wise, but we’ll experience the restoration of our world and the warmth of God’s protective presence forever (Romans 10:9).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will give you eyes to see the God who searches the earth and our hearts, and knows who we truly are. And may you see Jesus, who is God in the flesh, and who restores our world and protects us by his presence. "

This psalm contrasts the twisted and deceptive words of humans with the pure and true words of God. 

David feels like he’s living in Sodom and Gomorrah where no good person could be found (Psalm 12:1; Genesis 18:32). David is surrounded by liars, self-promoters, and enemies with deceptive hearts (Psalm 12:2). These evil people lie to the poor and needy to get what they want (Psalm 12:5a). They’re so proud they even believe that they can talk their way out of God’s judgment (Psalm 12:4). 

But David knows God will rise up, judge the liars, and rescue the poor and needy (Psalm 12:5). While the words of men are mingled with ulterior motives and duplicity, God’s words are flawless (Psalm 12:6). While human mouths will always find justifications for failing to act, God’s promise to protect us is as good as done (Psalm 12:7).

David’s final words are confident. We don’t have to treat God’s words like the loophole-filled words of men. God’s pure and true words will destroy the lies and deceptions of men (Psalm 12:8).

Where is the Gospel? 

When the New Testament reflects on God’s word, it says, “In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways” (Hebrews 1:1). God’s pure voice and words came to us through people like David. But this verse goes on to say that “in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son” (Hebrews 1:2). 

Jesus is the Word of God in the flesh (John 1:1). All the trustworthiness and purity of God’s spoken word is perfectly demonstrated in Jesus. During his life, Jesus frequently called out the hypocritical tongues of the Pharisees while defending the rights of the poor (Luke 20:46-47). 

Eventually, the evil words of Jesus’ enemies would surround him, just like they surrounded David. The Pharisees believed Jesus was lying when he said he was God (John 8:58). So they told lies of their own (John 18:33-34). Jesus was subjected to a sham trial filled with planted evidence and false witnesses (Matthew 26:59-60). As judge, Pilate denied truth was even relevant in his case (John 18:38). Jesus died surrounded by lies and evil speech. 

But God used the deceit of the Pharisees to prove who Jesus was. Jesus died because of their words, but the Word-made-flesh rose from the grave. There is no fine print. It is impossible for God to lie (Hebrews 6:18). If we trust in the true words of Jesus, every lying word spoken against us will never ultimately succeed. God is true—and every man is a liar (Romans 3:4). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God whose words are perfect and always true. And may you see Jesus as the Word of God made flesh who rescues us from the lies of our enemies."

This is a unique psalm because it is also recorded in 2 Samuel 22. The heading lets us know that David wrote this psalm after being delivered by God from Saul, who wanted him dead. 

Appropriately, David uses lots of imagery and metaphors to communicate his extreme thankfulness to God for saving his life. 

God is a rock, shield, fortress, deliverer, and stronghold (Psalm 18:2). Each image adds complexity to the ways God miraculously keeps David safe from each encroaching attack. 

David imagines God with smoke coming out of his nostrils and fire blazing from his mouth (Psalm 18:8). From one blast of his breath, the foundations of the earth are laid bare (Psalm 18:15). His presence manifests as hailstones and coals of fire breaking through dark clouds (Psalm 18:12). The New Testament even says, “God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:29). 

David thanks God for coming to his aid and destroying his enemies (Psalm 18:16-17). He is full of gratitude that this same God also graciously wraps himself in darkness so that his holy power will not destroy those who look to and love him (Psalm 18:11).

Rather than destroying him, God’s holy power strengthens David. God gives him the strength to bend a bow made out of bronze (Psalm 18:34), and makes his feet faster than a deer’s (Psalm 18:33). Because of God, both David’s earthly and spiritual enemies are judged and destroyed. 

David ends his psalm by repeating God’s promise that one of his offspring will sit on the throne forever (Psalm 18:50b). David is confident that an heir to his throne will loyally love his people and rescue them, not just for a period of time, but forever (Psalm 18:50a).

Where is the Gospel?

The loyal, loving, and victorious heir to David’s throne is Jesus (Matthew 1:1). He is the offspring of David who brings salvation to all people out of his compassion and love forever. Jesus is a rock, shield, fortress, deliverer, and stronghold to all who bend the knee to him. And one of the ways Jesus lovingly brings salvation to his people is by destroying evil and those who love it. 

We’re told that when Jesus returns for the final time it will be like a blazing fire for those who refuse his gracious reign (2 Thessalonians 1:8). The heat of God’s fire will evaporate the chaotic seas (Revelation 21:1). And in his mouth there will be a sword that judges the world (Revelation 19:15). The sword is a warning. Anyone who rejects God’s words will be cut down by them.

But God’s words will not simply destroy. They will make all things new (Revelation 21:5). Those thirsty will be quenched by a world of perfect justice (Revelation 21:6). The anxious will be at peace. Even grief and loss will be made new. Jesus, furious at evil, is gentle with his own. When Jesus comes again, he promises to wipe away our tears and remind us that death and pain will be no more (Revelation 21:4). When Jesus returns, those things will have passed away, not just for a period of time but forever (Psalm 18:50a).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the holy God who judges the evil in our world. And may you see Jesus as the one who is returning not simply to judge the world, but to remake it and live with us forever. "

The exact situation that led David to write this prayer is unknown, but Israel was probably facing something like a severe famine (Psalm 4:1). In response, many Israelites apparently made sacrifices to false gods and idols, praying that they could stop the drought and bring rain (Psalm 4:2). 

These false god worshippers look to any person, any religion, or any means to solve their problem. David pictures them as selling their allegiance to anyone with a decent answer to their question, “Who will show us some good?” (Psalm 4:6). 

But David’s response to the famine is different. He invites Israel to be silent, to rest, and to fear the one true God (Psalm 4:4). While everyone else may be running around trying to solve their problems through works and sacrificing to false gods, David says he will lay down in peace and go to sleep because he trusts God (Psalm 4:8). 

David finds rest in a time of chaos. He finds plenty in a time of scarcity. Even though David and his people may experience a lack of food, dwindling supplies, and a shortage of everyday provisions, he trusts God. This is how David can say he has more joy with God in a famine than those without God at a rich banquet (Psalm 4:7). David would rather be poor and with the true God, than rich and with idols. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Our world is still filled with false gods who offer solutions to all the modern famines we face. Consider what people refer to as a personal drought, including times when all the purpose, joy, opportunities, and friends in life seem to dry up. It is so easy to turn to anyone who can “show us some good.” 

Whether it be personal self-discovery, sexual exploration, or a departure from religious faith altogether, there are plenty of false gods that say they can make us happy. 

The obvious problem is that they, like the idols worshiped by the people in Psalm 4, are fake and powerless. We need something real. That is why David asked to see God’s face, to experience his nearness, to know his presence (Psalm 4:6b). 

The good news is that Jesus is described as the very light of God’s face (2 Corinthians 4:6). Jesus is the only one who proves himself as truly God. He is not a picture of an imagined god or idol. Jesus is the exact image of God (Colossians 1:15).

Jesus proves this by going through a famine no human can survive—the drought of the grave. When Jesus lay down to sleep in the tomb, God made him dwell in safety by raising him from the dead (Acts 13:34). 

When physical or personal famines enter our lives, we don’t have to work and toil to find ways to solve them. We can rest in the knowledge that if God can conquer the grave, he can conquer anything. When we rest in what Jesus has done for us, we can have joy even when things are bad.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will give you eyes to see the God who alone is able to solve the famines of our lives. And may you see Jesus as the only one who can pull us out of whatever drought we are in by the good news of what he did for us on the cross."

But Jesus' death and resurrection do.",Website,Psalms Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

This psalm of David deals with the experience of God’s hiddenness—those times when life is so hard God seems absent. 

David asks how long God will forget him and hide his face from him (Psalm 13:1). His heart is full of sorrow because his enemies are oppressing him (Psalm 13:2). These oppressors even celebrate the bad things happening to him (Psalm 13:4). 

When things get this bad, it is common for us to think God has abandoned us. Like David, the most natural way to process our experience is to question God. “Where are you? Why aren’t you acting? Why are you letting this happen?”

But if God remains silent, like David all we can do is ask God to act in our favor (Psalm 13:3).

Despite David’s experience, emotions, and assumptions, he holds fast to the truth of who God is. The psalm ends with a confession of trust. David says that he trusts in God’s unfailing love (Psalm 13:5). The word for unfailing love is not really describing the emotion of God’s love, but his loyal covenant commitment to Israel and David. 

God has made promises in the past to his people and David holds onto these promises when everything else washes away. He looks back on God’s bountiful dealings with him and his people—and it causes him to sing praises to God in the midst of sorrow (Psalm 13:6). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The hiddenness David experienced would also be experienced by Jesus himself. 

Jesus was killed on a cross by his enemies, though he did nothing to deserve it. But more importantly Jesus also willingly took responsibility before God for sins that were not his fault. Jesus allowed our sin to separate him from his Father. This is why Jesus cries out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46). On the cross Jesus experienced a planet’s worth of divine silence and God’s absence. 

But Jesus did this willingly because of his loyal love for us. He was forsaken so we could be accepted. Regardless of what goes wrong in your life, even when things are as bad as they can possibly get, in Jesus we have proof of God’s eternally loyal love for us.

In Jesus we can know that neither our circumstances nor our enemies define the terms and the extent of God’s love. But Jesus’ death and resurrection do. And if Jesus was willing to die, there is nothing—not even death—that can separate us from his love for us (Romans 8:38-39). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is loyal and faithful, even through the worst circumstances. And may you see Jesus as the one who was forsaken so that we would be accepted."

This psalm was meant to be read by the people of Israel before their king and his men entered a battle. 

On the eve of battle, Israel asks God to bring his divine aid to the upcoming skirmish (Psalm 20:2). They plead for God’s favorable response by obediently presenting offerings and sacrifices (Psalm 20:3).

Israel anticipates shouting for joy when God saves them from the encroaching attack. They plan to celebrate their victory by flying Israel's flag over newly conquered territory (Psalm 20:5). 

For Israel, these victories aren’t just political, they’re theological. Ever since the creation of Adam, God’s plan has been for his people to have dominion over the whole earth (Genesis 1:28) and be a blessing to all nations (Genesis 17:6). When God and his people rule the whole earth there is peace for all people and the banishment of all evil. Psalms like this one remind God of his globe-spanning promises and call on him to anoint a king to carry them out (Psalm 20:6). 

Israel knows God will build his kingdom through his king and his power. Ultimately, it is not their weapons, but their God who gives them the victory (Psalm 20:7). 

Where is the Gospel?

For a period of time, God’s presence and power was expressed through military force. But the greatest battle God would win—and the most significant advances of God’s Kingdom—would not come from weapons of war (John 18:36). Victory would come, as this psalm says, when God sends aid from his sanctuary (Psalm 20:2). 

And that aid is not warfare, but his Son Jesus. Jesus wouldn’t bring salvation by overcoming his enemies with weapons or violence. Instead, he allowed his enemies to overcome him on the cross. This wasn’t pointless, it was part of his strategy to defeat not just wicked rulers, but the cause of wicked rulers (sin) and the threat of evil kings (death). 

The true battle for the Kingdom of God was not against a flesh and blood enemy, but against spiritual forces of evil (Ephesians 6:12). So when Jesus died on the cross, he absorbed the most violent blow that sinful leaders can inflict—death. But God saved his anointed one, just like this psalm predicted (Psalm 20:6a). Jesus conquered his people’s enemies and has now taken his throne. 

It’s tempting to trust in military power, political strength, and legislative bodies to protect us, but those who trust in the Lord will always rise, even from the dead (Psalm 20:7-8). There is no political or spiritual force that has done battle with God’s King and won. So hear the Gospel: Jesus is on the throne! And he promises to fight for anybody who is willing to call out to him and ask for victory. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who provides victory for his people. And may you see Jesus who establishes his Kingdom through sacrificial love instead of horses and chariots.  "

Jesus offers us a way out of the meaninglessness we experience.",Website,Ecclesiastes Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

The book of Ecclesiastes is a book of wisdom. The Preacher’s wisdom reveals that everything under the sun, everything in this world, is “meaningless” or “futile” or “vain.” It’s the central point of the entire book and the first and last words of the Preacher’s teaching (Ecclesiastes 1:2; 12:8). Over and over again he imagines “futility” as “chasing after or striving after wind.” As soon as we try to grab it, it slips through our fingers. 

The Hebrew word the Preacher uses is sometimes translated as “smoke.” Like wind, smoke seems solid, but as soon as we get near it, it disappears. This is the Preacher’s conclusion about life: nothing in this life is as solid as we think. And the harder we try to grip it, the easier it slips away.

The Preacher proves this by describing how sun, wind, and seas are totally indifferent to human effort (Ecclesiastes 1:5). Even our efforts to innovate, change, and lead are just repetitions (Ecclesiastes 1:9). All has been done before and everything will be tried again. (Ecclesiastes 1:11).

The Preacher’s wisdom is simple: The more humans grasp for “solid” things under the sun (like love or money or power or justice), the more they turn out to be like smoke and wind.  (Ecclesiastes 1:4). And ultimately, everything in our lives is like wind because the only solid thing is death (Ecclesiastes 1:4,11). No matter what we grab in this life, we can’t take it with us.

This isn’t the Preacher’s pessimism or depression coloring his point of view. It’s the wise conclusion of a life spent experiencing all the world has to offer and realizing it all comes up short (Ecclesiastes 1:16). 

Where is the Gospel?

On the surface, this sounds like bad news. But the Preacher is giving us true (if painful) wisdom about life on earth. Life under the sun is full of things that seem solid but turn out to be smoke. And even if something seems solid for a time, death always reveals its futility. 

The Preacher’s goal is for us to trust the world less, and God more (Ecclesiastes 12:13). And the good news of Ecclesiastes is that God is not like smoke or wind. His commands are wise and his judgment about the good life is solid (Ecclesiastes 12:14). 

And this truth is ultimately seen in Jesus. In Jesus, God’s wisdom becomes solid in a world of smoke. 

God’s wisdom does battle with the most solid thing the Preacher knew—death. For a moment, Jesus’s death seems like just another example of something we thought was solid, but turned out to be wind. But when Jesus rises from the dead he proves that God is the only solid thing in a world of futility and death.This is why Paul calls Jesus’ death the power and wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1:23-24).

 We escape the futility of death and are resurrected “to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading” (1 Peter 1:4). In Christ’s resurrection we have both proof that God’s wisdom won’t vanish when we grab it, and hope that living according to his wisdom is not marked by futility but eternal significance and meaning.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is solid in a world of smoke. And may you see Jesus as the one who secures a solid, imperishable, unfading resurrection by his death."

One day, God will make low the proud and exalt the humble. This day of hope comes to us in Jesus.",Website,Ecclesiastes Bible Study,"What is Happening?

The Preacher ends his book with a final encouragement to remember and worship God while we are still young. Many believe the book of Ecclesiastes is best read as an older king giving advice to the heir of his throne. So the Preacher is training his son to one day be a wise king. As the Preacher’s fatherly advice draws to a close, he reminds his son, “Remember your Creator in the days of your youth” (Ecclesiastes 12:1). It’s a final warning for a son poised to rule a world of futility.

The Preacher tells his son to expect weariness and disenchantment if he refuses to remember God. If his son chooses to reflect only on things “under the sun,” he will find that everything is meaningless, just like his father did (Ecclesiastes 12:8). So the Preacher paints this picture of a life lived without reference to God. It’s a ghost town. A city and a people on the verge of death. Productivity vanishes. Industries close (Ecclesiastes 12:4). Windows are shuttered. Songs are not sung in the streets. Funerals are common (12:5). It’s so quiet in the city; the only noticeable sounds are birds chirping in the ruins (Ecclesiastes 12:4b). If the son refuses to honor God, he should not be surprised by the apocalypse that comes to his kingdom.

Everything the Preacher has said should act like a goad, a sharp stick, that pricks the son when he wanders off the path (Ecclesiastes 12:11). The bleak vision of the future and all the futility under the sun should drive him back to center: to “fear God and keep his commands” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). 

Where is the Gospel?

Throughout the book of Ecclesiastes the Preacher made the point that what makes life meaningless is the haphazard way our efforts fall short of our rewards. Hard-earned wealth vanishes. Hard-fought justice is perverted. Hard-sought wisdom doesn’t bring clarity. Good people die young and evil people thrive. It’s all chasing after the wind.

But the final words of Ecclesiastes give us the reason why fearing God and keeping his commands is actually worth it in a world of smoke and eventual apocalypse: “God will bring every deed into judgment... whether it is good or evil” (Ecclesiastes 12:14).

This is the great hope of Ecclesiastes—and the great hope of the entire Bible. Jesus is coming to judge. Just look at all these verses in the New Testament that guarantee judgment: 2 Timothy 4:1, 8; James 5:9; Acts 10:38-42, 17:31; 2 Corinthians 5:10; John 5:22-30, 8:15-16, 9:39, 12:47-48; Romans 2:16, 14:10; Revelation 19:11. For those who love God and keep his commands, the coming apocalypse is not a prediction of desolation and ruin, but the glorious restoration of God’s Kingdom under the rule of The King’s true son— Jesus. 

In Jesus’ Kingdom, everything the Preacher observed will no longer be true. All of our good works will be rewarded the way they deserve to be (2 Corinthians 5:10). Our hard-earned wealth won’t vanish because God’s wealth will become ours (Philippians 4:19). All the injustice done against us will be exposed and our suffering will be vindicated (Revelation 11:18). And far from dying young, we will live forever; not in a ruin, but with God in his beautiful city (Revelation 21:2).

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the good news of the God who judges. And may you see Jesus as the King who has come to rule and reign over his perfect Kingdom forever."

The final sections of Ecclesiastes can feel somewhat disjointed. But this is a feature of wisdom literature, not a flaw in its system. Wisdom rarely comes to us in a neat package. It’s earned in fits and starts through moments of suffering and decades of relationships. The book of Ecclesiastes mirrors the way we gain wisdom in our own life. As you read, keep this in mind. But also watch out for the Preacher's main concerns: the unknowability of the future and the certainty of death. 

The Preacher says that we know very little about what’s to come (Ecclesiastes 6:12). We don’t know—much less control—the day we die (Ecclesiastes 8:7-8). And we don’t know what happens after we die (Ecclesiastes 6:12). 

Even if you take these obvious unknowns off the table, the Preacher confronts us with the unknowable amount of information about the world God has made. No amount of researching, reading, or googling will bring us exhaustive knowledge of ourselves or the universe (Ecclesiastes 8:17). There will always be questions science can’t answer, such as, “When does consciousness begin?” (Ecclesiastes 11:5).

Rather than tiring themselves over answers they can’t know, wise people focus on the thing they know for certain—death. “The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth” (Ecclesiastes 7:4). Death is the only constant . And death comes for both the righteous and the sinner just the same (Ecclesiastes 7:2). 

The Preacher knows this isn’t the way the world should be. But by exposing futility, unknowability, and death as constants he is also accurately describing the world after God’s curse. The Preacher says the only hope in an uncertain and futile world is found in knowing that we will die (Ecclesiastes 9:3). 

Where is the Gospel?

We assume that if we know more about the world and have more life experiences, the better our lives will be. But the Preacher says the more experience, knowledge, and wisdom we get, the more dissatisfied, disappointed, and discontent our lives will become. No amount of knowledge can erase uncertainty, predict our future, or tell us what happens after we die.

That’s why the Preacher believes the best life is found in meditating on the certainty of death.

This is precisely where we see Jesus. Jesus was a man who meditated on death. We’re told Jesus was born to die for our sins (1 Timothy 1:15). And Jesus lived his life in the shadow of his death. He talked about it often (Mark 8:31). The Apostle Paul says all of history and Scripture prophesied that Jesus must die (1 Corinthians 15:3). Jesus even experienced death’s supposed certainty by spending three days in a grave. 

But Jesus doesn't just understand death; Jesus knows what happens after death. Unlike the sum of our accumulated knowledge, Jesus can predict the future. And when we meditate on Jesus’ death, when we make his grave and cross our certainty, we can know our future and what comes after death—eternal life. When Jesus enters the house of mourning, we gain access to his house of mirth and joy.

The Apostle Paul says that when we join Jesus’ death by our baptism, we also join ourselves to his life and unite ourselves to his resurrection (Romans 6:4-5). For those who fear God, unknowability and death are not constants. Certainty of eternal life is. Jesus, echoing the Preacher, said it this way: “Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it” (Matthew 10:39). What the sum of living human knowledge can not offer or predict is offered freely in Jesus’ death.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who reveals that true life is found in death. And may you see Jesus as the one who entered the house of mourning, so that we could enter his house of mirth."

The Preacher begins a long series of observations about life under the sun that prove his main point—that life is meaningless and futile. The Preacher’s observations are meant to contrast with the book of Proverbs. The observations in Proverbs are largely positive, but the Preacher’s are largely negative. Proverbs offers hope that the righteous will be blessed and the wicked will be punished. But Ecclesiastes exposes all the exceptions to Proverb’s rules. The simplest explanation is that Proverbs demonstrates how the world should be and Ecclesiastes exposes the world as it actually is.

Justice does not always win (Ecclesiastes 3:16). Oppressors are rewarded with more power while the oppressed are left destitute (Ecclesiastes 4:1). Hard work doesn’t always pay off (Ecclesiastes 5:13). And even when God brings blessings, it often comes with an inability to enjoy them (Ecclesiastes 6:2).

This futility, the Preacher says, is a test (Ecclesiastes 3:18). The longer we live and the more we read, the more obvious life’s futility will become. God will 

seem

 less trustworthy. We will see more and more examples of the book of Proverbs not playing out; more and more evidence that we live in a cursed world. The test is designed to push us towards trust in God and away from trusting the world (Ecclesiastes 5:7).

The Preacher intensifies the test by comparing humans to animals (Ecclesiastes 3:18). Like animals, we’re driven by competition and appetite (Ecclesiastes 6:7). We work because we envy our neighbor (Ecclesiastes 4:4). Like animals, we’re never satisfied (Ecclesiastes 5:12). And animals and humans share the same fate - from dust we came, to dust we will return (Ecclesiastes 3:20). The relentless, animalistic futility of the cursed world is always testing us. 

Will we despair that everything is meaningless?

Where is the Gospel?

No one felt the weight of this test more completely than Jesus. 

Justice did not win while Jesus lived. He was falsely accused by his jealous oppressors. His friends abandoned him. Like competitive animals, the Pharisees stripped and flayed Jesus’ skin to protect their power. Not satisfied with a beating they chanted, “Crucify him!” 

But in the Garden of Gethsamene Jesus had a choice. He could despair over the state of the cursed world and avoid it all, or he could trust God more than the futility of the world (Luke 22:42). And Jesus passes the test. He chooses to experience futility by taking responsibility for a curse he did not cause, yet be punished as if he had (2 Corinthians 5:21, Galatians 3:13).

Three days later Jesus proves that neither his death nor our lives are meaningless or futile. Jesus rises from the dead and proves that neither futility nor the curse have the final word. God does. 

In Jesus, the futility observed by the Preacher will be reversed. Justice will win. The oppressors will be punished and the oppressed will be lifted up. Our hard work won’t end in futility, but will be rewarded eternally. Our lives will be full of meaning when we trust Jesus’ resurrection as more true than the futility of the cursed world. Our suffering and futility are transformed from moments of despair into moments where God’s power and hope will be shown (2 Corinthians 12:9).

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who tests us. And may you see Jesus as the one who passes the test and gives meaning, life, and hope to all who trust in him."

One way to understand the book of Ecclesiastes is to understand it as a response to the question, “How should I spend my brief life on earth?” (Ecclesiastes 1:13; 3:10). The Preacher responds by testing some of the available options. 

At first, the Preacher spends his life pursuing pleasure (Ecclesiastes 2:10). Quickly, he finds the more pleasure he experiences, the less it satisfies him (Ecclesiastes 2:11). So he turns his appetite to wisdom only to find a similar dead end (Ecclesiastes 2:16). The more wisdom he acquires, the more problems he notices. Finally, The Preacher despairs because he sees that all work and achievement is futile since someone else will always take it over (Ecclesiastes 2:18).

The Preacher understands that part of the problem is timing. The timing of our pursuits and satisfaction always seems out of sync with God’s timing. God has ordained times of both pleasure and sadness (Ecclesiastes 3:3). And since we are not God, all our efforts to carve out some sort of contentment either feel too late, too early, or never enough. 

The Preacher explains it’s because God has placed in our hearts a desire for his eternity and to do things according to his timing (Ecclesiastes 3:11). After all, God’s timing is perfect. Nothing can be added or taken away from his purposes (Ecclesiastes 3:14). But the Preacher also understands that no matter what he tries, the timing of his efforts never sync with God’s timing for his pleasure.

Based on these observations the Preacher offers his wisdom in a world of eternally unmet expectations— enjoy the food, the wine, and the work God has given you while you have the chance (Ecclesiastes 2:24; 3:13).

Contentment is found in God’s time and from God’s hand. Instead of fearing poverty and chasing success, instead of fearing loneliness and grasping at pleasure or escape, and instead of fearing being foolish and burying yourself in books—fear God and enjoy what he has given you (Ecclesiastes 3:14). Nothing can be added or taken away from the wealth, pleasure, and wisdom found in what God does in his timing.

Where is the Gospel?

God is in control of time. We are not. Our lives are marked by disappointment and frustration. It always feels as if something can be added, or perhaps something has been taken away. To whatever extent we are out of sync with God’s timing and seasons, this will always be true. The only way we can eat our food, drink our wine, and enjoy our work is when our timing and God’s timing sync up. 

That’s what the Preacher means when he says eternity has been placed in our hearts. God puts within us a deep desire to be in sync with his time. We long to experience God’s eternity in such a way that nothing needs to be added or taken away from our actions or life moments. 

Synchronization between God’s time and our actions is not resolved until Jesus’ death. During his time on earth Jesus only did what he saw God do, when he told him to do it (John 1:3, John 5:19). This is why Jesus resisted pressure to reveal himself by saying repeatedly that his time or his hour had not yet come (John 2:4, 7:6). It’s also why Jesus, prior to his crucifixion, says that his hour had finally come (John 12:23). Jesus’ actions, and God’s timing were perfectly synced at the cross. Paul even says Jesus came in the “fullness of time” (Galatians 4:4).

And when Jesus died in the fullness of time, perfectly in sync with God’s eternal plans, he places in our hearts the gift of eternity—eternal life that cannot be added to or taken away. The Preacher understood “eternity in our hearts” as a description of the problem. But Jesus turns it into a gift. Not only will we finally be able to enjoy our food, wine, and work without frustration and disappointment, we will live eternally with God (John 10:28). 

Instead of being trapped in a life out of sync with God’s good plans and never experiencing the satisfaction we hope for, we can set our watches by Jesus’ life and death. He gives us resurrection life now and forever. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God whose actions endure forever. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives eternal life that cannot be added to or taken away from us."

A remnant, a small faithful band of Israelites, is finally coming home from exile in Persia (Ezra 2:1). This isn’t just a political event initiated by Persia but a sign that Israel’s relationship with God is being restored. God promised Abraham that his descendants would live in Israel and grow into a nation whose population couldn’t be counted (Genesis 12:2). And like Israel’s first immigration to the land began with a long census, so does the immigration led by Ezra (Numbers 1:2; Ezra 2:2). 

But this story of exile and return is ultimately about unmet expectations. Compared to the hundreds of thousands counted by Moses, only a few thousand return with Ezra (Ezra 2:64; Numbers 26:51). And some of them can’t even prove their families are a part of Israel at all (Ezra 2:59). But there is still hope. Zerubbabel’s family tree has remained strong. He is a descendant of both Abraham and King David (cf. Matthew 1:1-13). God promised one of David’s sons would reign next to his temple forever (2 Samuel 7:16). If anyone can restore Israel, it would be Zerubbabel! In hope, Zerubbabel and his company offer sacrifices and lay a new foundation for God’s temple (Ezra 3:10). Perhaps they wondered if repeating the sacrifices of their ancestors means God will again fill the temple and establish their nation.

But as the people celebrate the completion of the temple’s foundation the older men weep just as loudly (Ezra 3:12). They remember this foundation is nothing like the temple Solomon built (1 Kings 6:21-22). Like the disappointing census, this lesser temple is another of Israel’s unmet expectations. As promising as Israel’s return, Zerubbabel’s leadership, and a new temple are, God’s promises have not come true yet. 

Where is the Gospel?

Despite Israel’s disappointment, God still upheld the promises he made to Abraham and David. In fact he would use their unmet expectations to bring about what he promised. Israel was right to celebrate God’s goodness even in disappointment (Ezra 3:11). 

Even when Jesus came to finally end Israel’s exile and rebuild her temple in himself, it’s less impressive than expected. Jesus didn’t return from Egypt with hundreds of thousands but his one family (Matthew 2:21). And like many families in Ezra, Jesus’ lineage was suspect. He came from a backwater town and was born under suspicious circumstances (John 1:46). In fact, his genealogy included Gentiles. Jesus was not the King from David’s family tree that Israel expected (John 7:52). 

And Jesus’ life and rule was not what Israel expected either. His own disciples couldn’t believe that Jesus planned to die on a cross (Matthew 16:22). Yet, by rising from the dead, Jesus showed that God’s love endures even through unmet expectations. Even though he was the Savior they did not expect, he was their greatest Temple and King. Like Zerubbabel he rebuilt God’s temple not only in himself but in us (1 Peter 2:4-5). We are now filled with his Presence and the remnant of a new Kingdom, a new Israel specially claimed by God (1 Peter 2:10). In Jesus, unmet expectations become glorious surprise endings. And just like no one expects much from a mustard seed, we as a new people of God will grow larger and experience more of God’s Presence than anyone in Israel thought possible (Matthew 13:32). 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is faithful through unmet expectations. And that you will see Jesus who turns unmet expectations into glorious surprise endings."

Nehemiah has rebuilt Jerusalem’s walls. He’s also rebuilt Israel’s purpose among the nations. Walls don’t just protect, they separate those inside from those outside. Israel was supposed to be holy—a set apart and separate people (Deuteronomy 7:6). God uniquely loved them, so they were to uniquely love God. And God’s law showed Israel how to be distinct from the world around them. The completed walls were a visual and concrete reminder of the same (Nehemiah 9:2). 

Ezra the scribe reenters the story and reads the books of Moses to a large assembly of his people (Nehemiah 8:2). This public reading of Scripture sparks a chain reaction of Bible studies (Nehemiah 8:8). The people are desperate to hear what God’s law says and what it demands of them. They want to obey God because he has loved them. And after reading the Law every day for seven days, the people of Israel repent for their failure to obey God’s laws (Nehemiah 8:18-9:1). 

Ezra leads a long public prayer of repentance. It recounts the entire story of God’s people, including how God created the universe and called their forefather Abraham out of the whole earth (Nehemiah 9:7). It continues with how God sustained them with food and water for 40 years in the wilderness (Nehemiah 9:21) and how he rescued their ancestors from Egypt and brought them to the promised land (Nehemiah 9:24). 

As the people of Israel hear their story, they confess they have consistently hardened their hearts toward God. They admit it was their disobedience that led to their exile (Nehemiah 9:17). But through it all, God was faithful, gracious, long-suffering, and true to his promises (Nehemiah 9:31). In response to God’s love the people of Israel recommit to obey God and follow his law (Nehemiah 9:38). And Israel’s princes, priests, and rulers sign their names to a contract before God and Nehemiah (Nehemiah 10:1). With their new wall marking them off and God’s word ringing in their ears, Israel promises to distinguish themselves from the surrounding nations and obey their loving God (Nehemiah 10:29). 

Where is the Gospel? 

God’s word makes us holy. When Ezra read the story of God’s people to Israel, they were moved by the endless ways God had shown grace and mercy to them throughout all their disobedience. When we engage with the Bible it does the same. It convicts us, shapes us, and makes us into the people of God.

And the apostle Matthew says that Jesus has fulfilled the law (Matthew 5:17). Hearing and believing the story and commands of Jesus make us into God’s people. As God has uniquely loved us in Jesus, we’re compelled to uniquely obey God. Like Israel, when we hear and believe the acts of grace and mercy God has shown us in Jesus we become more and more God’s separate and holy people (2 Corinthians 3:18). The good news for the consistently hardhearted is that the story of Jesus can melt our hearts and make us holy. What the law did for Israel, Jesus does for us through his Gospel. 

And now as God’s holy people, we live empowered by the Holy Spirit to lead holy lives (1 Peter 1:15-16). We are the separated people of God, living according to new standards of love and sacrifice. We are not marked off by physical walls, but by the Holy Spirit within us (Ephesians 1:13). God has not changed. But when God’s people listen to God’s word, they are changed from one degree of glory to the next.

King Ahab has just disobeyed God. He’s allowed a bloodthirsty king to walk free in return for a trade partnership with Syria. One of God’s prophets immediately condemns him for this and predicts his coming death (1 Kings 20:42). Rather than repent, Ahab pouts and looks to a vineyard for comfort (1 Kings 21:2).

But the owner Naboth (whose name is a play on the word “prophet”) refuses to sell (1 Kings 21:4). Ahab’s wife Jezebel cheers her husband up by sending lying witnesses to publicly accuse Naboth during a religious festival (1 Kings 21:7, 9). They incite a mob, claiming Naboth has “cursed both God and the king.” They then murder him (1 Kinds 21:10). Opposition removed, the royal family seizes the vineyard (1 Kings 21:16) Ahab is a king who murders his citizens and lets the bloodthirsty go free. God is displeased (1 Kings 21:25-26). 

So God sends Elijah to prophesy the end of Ahab's dynasty (1 Kings 21:21). Ahab will die in the same vineyard he stole. And the dogs he let lick up Naboth’s blood will in turn drink his blood (1 Kings 21:19). For a moment, Ahab humbles himself before God. But it only delays the judgment against his family (1 Kings 21:29). 

Three years later, the king of Judah wants to go to war with Syria and take the strategic city of Ramoth Gilead (1 Kings 22:29). Ahab has surrounded himself with 400 prophets “of the Lord,” but really, they’re all yes men to Ahab’s ambitions. Each one gives the same ambiguous prophecy, “the Lord will give it into the king’s hand” (1 Kings 22:6). But give what—and to which king?

The king of Judah is dissatisfied and asks for another prophet, Micaiah, who leaves no room for interpretation (1 Kings 22:8). Israel will be scattered like sheep without a shepherd and Ahab will die in battle (1 Kings 22:17). Ahab wants to dismiss Micaiah, but Micaiah reveals that God has filled his prophets with a lying spirit to trap Ahab, just like Jezebel sent lying witnesses to kill Naboth (1 Kings 22:22). 

Spooked, Ahab goes to battle in disguise but it does nothing to stop God’s justice (1 Kings 22:30). A stray arrow fatally pierces his armor. He bleeds out back home by his stolen vineyard, and dogs lick up his blood (1 Kings 22:37-38). 

Where is the Gospel?

According to Jesus, the story of Ahab and Naboth is the story of Israel. The people of Israel are tenants of a vineyard they didn’t plant (Matthew 21:33). When God’s prophets come to announce the bill and collect the rent, Israel turns murderous (Matthew 21:35). Ahab’s treatment of Naboth foreshadows the faithlessness that will eventually kill God’s ultimate prophet, Jesus (Matthew 21:37). Like Naboth, false witnesses accuse him of cursing both God and king. A mob seals both of their fates. And like Ahab, Israel’s leaders murder their own prophet and let a bloodthirsty man go free.

Jesus dies, but his death isn’t like other prophets’ deaths. Jesus’ death is a trap like the one God set for Ahab. But Jesus isn’t just another victim. His death is a kind of deception against the wicked rulers of the earth (1 Corinthians 2:8). And like Ahab’s lying spirits baited him to his death, Jesus gave us his spirit and baited the rulers of this age to their deaths. 

The powers of death and the lies of the enemy are undone, in the same moment they thought they were victorious (Colossians 2:15). God is cunning. He is smarter than our enemy and is able to trap even the grave into giving up its dead (1 Corinthians 15:55). So now, if any of us humble ourselves before our cunning God, not even death can stand against us. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is cunning and just. And may you see Jesus as the rejected prophet whose death destroys wicked rulers and gives the humble eternal life."

Elisha is about to heal leprous Naaman, a wealthy Syrian general (2 Kings 5:1). But it’s important to know this story is a sequel. Elisha has just raised a wealthy Shunammite’s son from the dead and Naaman’s story has a similar cast: Elisha, Gehazi, a little child, and a wealthy person. In both stories servants act as mediators between Elisha and those in need. The Shunammite’s son sneezes seven times when he’s raised from the dead, and Naaman is cleansed after seven dips in the Jordan river. Gehazi is shown as faithless in both stories. And the question, “Is all well?” is answered in both narratives with varying degrees of deception. This type of repetition escalates our expectations of what Elisha and God might do next. 

When God raises the Shunammite’s son we know that God gives life to his people, but when God heals a Syrian’s leprosy we know that God gives life to all people. 

A little girl tells Naaman that he should travel to the prophet Elisha in Israel and ask for healing from his leprosy  (2 Kings 5:3). So Naaman asks Israel’s king to connect him with Elisha (2 Kings 5:5). But the king of Israel is convinced the whole thing is a trap and doesn’t think to direct Naaman to the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 5:7). Sarcastically he asks, “Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life?” Elisha overhears the king and tells him to send Naaman his way. Soon both Israel’s king and Namaan will know that there is a prophet of God in Israel (2 Kings 5:8).

Naaman expects to pay for his miracle and he expects Elisha to cure him with a wave of his hand (2 Kings 5:11). But Elisha refuses to leave his house. He sends a messenger to tell him to wash in the Jordan seven times (2 Kings 5:10). Naaman storms off. He did not come to Israel to take a bath in their dirty rivers and be ignored (2 Kings 5:12). But desperate, he does it anyway, and his skin and soul are reborn (2 Kings 5:14).

Naaman returns to Elisha convinced he’s a prophet, but more significantly that God is the only God in all the earth (2 Kings 5:15). Naaman wants to pay Elisha for his services, but he refuses (2 Kings 5:16). Elisha will not take credit for what God does for free. As a token of his new faith, Naaman loads his mules with Israeli dirt to remind him in Syria that the true God is the God of Israel (2 Kings 5:17).

Leprous Naaman came to Israel loaded with what he thought a miracle would cost—and learned God’s cleansing costs nothing. But Gehazi runs after Naaman and lies to get what he thinks is fair compensation for a miracle (2 Kings 5:22). Gehazi wants to profit from God’s power. So God’s prophet gives Gehazi the same leprosy he wanted to charge for (2 Kings 5:27). 

Where is the Gospel?

God is the God who kills and makes alive. He both heals lepers and causes leprosy. He cleanses for free and he defiles those who try to profit from his power. No matter how desperate or reluctant, whether Syrian or Shunammite, healing is for everyone who trusts the God of Israel.

God is no less powerful or gracious today. Like Elisha, Jesus raised the dead and cleansed lepers. He healed for Roman centurions and for Jewish housewives alike. And when Jesus’ disciples encounter a man trying to buy the power of God, he’s cursed for his presumption (Acts 8:20). God is still the God who kills and makes alive. God is still the God of free grace for all people. 

And like Naaman we can come to God’s final prophet and be reborn. By Jesus’ living words and by the waters of his baptism we are healed and saved (1 Peter 1:23, Titus 3:5). In the water, we are cleansed from what defiles us and we are forgiven of our sins. In the water God buries our old lives and raises us from the dead to new ones (Romans 6:4). Like Naaman our skin and our souls can be reborn, not by Elisha in the Jordan but Jesus’ word and his baptism. 

So come to the water, not with gold or good works, but with your leprosy and sin. Come ready to be washed by the words of Jesus and be forever cleaned. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who kills and makes alive. And may you see Jesus’ words and baptism as your free salvation."

Repeat,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ec12d1cd984b7ed1155746/6402933e4b57269e986b4bf4_book-hero-ph.webp,https://www.spokengospel.com/devotionals/1-kings-15-16#read,,"In 1 Kings 15-16, we see that Jesus breaks the pattern of Israel's history and saves us to a life free from the monotony of idolatry.",Website,1 & 2 Kings Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The first 60 years of Israel’s history took 13 chapters to explore. The next 60 take three. The narrative speeds up as Israel’s history repeats itself over and over. A king rises, rules, sins, and dies. Over and over and over again. Live. Sin. Die. Repeat.

The author repetitively and monotonously lists king after similarly named king engaging in similar wars with similar judgments: “He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, following the ways of his father” (1 Kings 15:26). Even the details our author shares are extremely limited. The political intrigue of Solomon’s days and the exciting battles of David’s reign are gone, replaced with short, detail-thin summaries and a reminder to look up more information in the history books (1 Kings 15:23). The effect is numbing. If you’ve read Kings before, you’ve probably felt desensitized. But don’t feel guilty for that—you’re supposed to feel that way. Israel’s idolatry and disobedience are increasingly violent, repetitive, and so boring.

The only bright spot is King Asa in Judah (1 Kings 15:11). He undoes some of the sins of his parents, although fails to regain Israel’s former glory or fidelity (1 Kings 15:12-13). But his godliness is overshadowed by Omri and his son Ahab. Omri did more evil than all the kings before him (1 Kings 16:25), and Ahab made even his father’s evil look trivial (1 Kings 16:31a). 

Ahab marries Jezebel, a foreign queen, and together they formally institute the worship of Baal in the land of the Lord (1 Kings 16:32-33). The worship of Baal frequently involved human sacrifice, which Ahab freely permits. He allows a subordinate to sacrifice his two sons to rebuild Jericho, the Canaanite city Joshua destroyed (1 Kings 16:34). Ahab undoes the life and vitality God brought through Joshua. He rebuilds the immorality Israel has destroyed before, and dooms Israel to more of the same.

Where is the Gospel?

We don’t need three chapters to explain what happens throughout the rest of history. We live. We sin. We die. New gods, new names, new cultures. But it’s always the same pattern on repeat. We live. We sin. We die.

The god Baal (no less than our own culture) promised that sexual experimentation in his temple would mean fertility, happiness, and prosperity (1 Kings 15:12). And humans have yet to learn that bowing to Baal always leads to the same repeated patterns of barrenness, loss, and destitution. Joyless sex, loveless marriages, and broken families are millenniums-old repetitions of the same boring idolatry (Romans 1:23). 

The only way to break free from the monotony of our idolatry is to worship the living God (1 Thessalonians 1:9). Like Asa brought life back to Israel, when we worship the living God we reverse the repetitiveness of death and decay and make space for creativity, life, and vitality. 

The name of that living God is Jesus. In the wilderness, Satan offered Jesus a kingdom of wealth and power if he would just kneel (Matthew 4:8-9). But Jesus refused to bow to the promises of the impotent Satan and instead only followed the God of Life (John 5:19) Just as Asa refused to bow to the promises of a false God, Jesus ends the monotony of death and idolatry. He innovates eternal life for people condemned to death. He makes sinners into new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17). Like Joshua, we become vigorous and vital warriors of life in a world ruled by death. In Jesus it’s no longer live, sin, die, repeat. It’s now life dead to sin, eternal vitality, and never-ending exploration of the creativity, life, and vigor of the living God. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God as better than idols. And may you see Jesus as the living God who frees us from the monotony of death and decay."

Judah is under Babylonian control (2 Kings 24:1). But Jehoiakim, Judah’s governor, unsuccessfully rebels and is waylaid by enemy skirmishes (2 Kings 24:2). When Jehoiakim’s son takes over the governorship he rules for only three months before surrendering to the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 24:12). Nebuchadnezzar empties the temple of its treasures and sends a first wave of exiles from Jerusalem to Babylon (2 Kings 24:13-14). 

Jehoiakim’s brother also tries to rebel against Babylon but fails (2 Kings 24:20). Nebuchadnezzar retaliates and besieges Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:1). The brother flees Jerusalem but he’s caught. As punishment his sons are executed in front of him, his eyes are gouged out, and he’s shipped to a Babylonian prison (2 Kings 25:6-7). Nebuchadnezzar burns Jerusalem and its temple to the ground and exiles a second wave to Babylon (2 Kings 25:9, 11). The charred bronze of the temple is measured, broken down, and shipped into the empire’s treasury (2 Kings 25:13). The temple’s priests are murdered and Judah begins its long exile (2 Kings 25:21). 

Nebuchadnezzar installs a new Judean governor under the watchful eyes of Babylonian officials (2 Kings 25:22). But both the governor and Nebuchadnezzar’s officials are immediately assassinated by a few rebels who avoided the first waves of deportations (2 Kings 25:25). Afraid of further retaliation, the remaining population of Judah seeks asylum in Egypt; the same place God rescued their ancestors from (2 Kings 25:26). God’s people are back where they started—landless, enslaved to an empire, trapped in Egypt, and as good as dead.

Thirty-seven years later a new, more benevolent, Babylonian king exonerates and frees Jehoiakim’s son from prison (2 Kings 25:27). He seats him at his royal table and replaces his prison uniform with clothes fitting a man of his table (2 Kings 25:29). The history of Israel and Judah ends with the barest of hopes. Israel has fallen. Judah has fallen. The temple is burned. God’s laws are forgotten. The kings are deposed. The prophets are dead. But a descendant of David has been shown grace and been raised up near the center of pagan power. 

Israel’s history isn’t about dates and cities and kings; it’s about God. And what we learn from Israel’s national story is that God does not save through nations, temples, laws, kings, or prophets. God saves by grace alone and God gives life even after death.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus is the culmination of Israel’s political, prophetic, and spiritual expectations. Jesus is a son of David and the rightful King of Israel (Matthew 21:9). He’s the final Temple and the Law demonstrated (Matthew 5:17). He’s both prophecy come true and the last Prophet (Hebrews 1:1-2). 

But for Jesus to be the Savior of Israel’s history, he must historically die. To save Israel, he must be Israel. To redeem Israel from her sin and rescue her from her idolatry, he must embody her sin and idolatry (2 Corinthians 5:21). Like Babylon, the empires of Sin and Death would overwhelm Jesus. Outside the city, rejected by his disciples, murdered by the powers, and forsaken by God, Jesus relives both Israel’s history and Israel’s death. But like Jehoiakim’s son, Jesus rises from his exile and is now seated at God’s table, clothed in glory—not near the center of pagan power, but as the center of life, death, and the universe (Ephesians 1:20-21).

All authority has been given to Jesus (Matthew 28:18). More gracious than the King of Babylon, he promises an end to our exile on earth, a home in his Kingdom, and resurrection from the dead. Jesus promises to elevate and strengthen humbled, weakened, and humiliated people like us. And he will even replace our prison garb with robes of righteousness and seat us with him at his table (Ephesians 2:6).

Manasseh replaces Hezekiah as Judah’s king, and he’s the worst. He rebuilds the shrines Hezekiah tore down, erects altars to Baal and Asherah inside God’s temple, burns his son on their altars, consults with necromancers, murders the innocent, and reverts Israel to a state worse than when they first entered the land (2 Kings 21:9, 11). Fittingly, Manasseh’s name means “forgetful.” Israel has forgotten the God who saved them—and everything God saved them to be. So God “forgets” his previous grace and determines to exile Judah and end His relationship with her (2 Kings 21:14).

But Manasseh’s grandson Josiah is nothing like his grandfather (2 Kings 22:2). He is the only man in Scripture said to fulfill God’s law with his whole heart, soul, and might (2 Kings. 23:25). He repairs the temple that his grandfather desolated (2 Kings 22:5). And when he discovers a lost copy of God’s Word, he realizes the extent of Judah’s sins and grieves (2 Kings 22:11). Beginning with the temple, Josiah undoes the idolatry of Judah and Israel’s past. He dismantles the golden calves Jeroboam used to divide the kingdom, and burns the bones of the false prophets and priests who facilitated the cult (2 Kings 23:15-16). The only bones he leaves undisturbed belong to the unnamed prophet who predicted his reign (1 Kings 13:2, 2 Kings 23:17). And then, for the first time since Joshua reigned, Israel celebrates the Passover (2 Kings 23:22). Israel has never had a king like Josiah.

But it’s not enough (2 Kings 23:26). Unprecedented obedience by one king does not undo the atrocities of another, let alone centuries of violence and harm caused by Judah’s forgetfulness (2 Kings 23:27). Josiah is unceremoniously killed in battle against Egypt. His son is crowned but three months later deposed (2 Kings 23:33). And Egypt installs a puppet-king who’s willing to extort his own people to pay the costs of another kingdom (2 Kings 23:35).

Where is the Gospel?

Josiah shows us that obedience to God’s law cannot reverse generations of forgetfulness and idolatry. God’s law is impotent to save God’s people from her prophesied destruction. The apostle Paul says that the law confined people to disobedience to make them hope for a Final Savior (Galatians 3:22). God’s law couldn’t save, but it could teach Israel what they truly needed. God’s people would not be saved by Josiah’s obedience to the law, but by faith in King Jesus (Galatians 3:24).  

Josiah’s obedience delayed Judah’s destruction, but that abatement only lasted as long as he lived. A faithful king can only save if he’s on the throne. But unlike Josiah, who rose from his throne to die, Jesus rose from the dead to rule (Romans 8:34). When we trust Jesus, we are trusting a King who can never die. And so the destruction of God’s people is eternally delayed! There is never an exile for those in King Jesus (Romans 8:1).

God has not forgotten his people. Rather, in Jesus, he forgets our forgetfulness (Hebrews 8:12). God remembers our sins no more. And right now, he is making us into a people unable to forget his grace and law (Hebrews 8:10-11). If you are a Manasseh, he wants to make you a Josiah (2 Corinthians 5:17). He promises to fill you with himself, allowing you to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, strength.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to the God who judges our forgetfulness. And may you see Jesus as our unforgetful King who nevertheless remembers our sins no more."

Hezekiah takes the throne in Judah, but his allegiances are divided (2 Kings 18:1). He’s the first king in centuries to tear down the shrines that dot Judah’s landscape (2 Kings 18:4). But in six years Assyria will overthrow Israel and test Hezekiah’s faith in the process. Assyria’s king, Sennacherib, is a gifted tactician who levels several Judean fortified cities (2 Kings 18:13). But instead of trusting God, Hezekiah raids God’s temple of its silver and gold to pay off the ruthless king (2 Kings 18:15-16). Hezekiah’s allegiance is divided and Sennacherib takes advantage. He sends a delegation of counselors to force a surrender to Assyria and her gods (2 Kings 18:17). Cleverly, the Assyrian delegate makes sure to sound like an Israelite prophet. He tells Hezekiah not to trust in Egypt or her horses. He promises a land flowing with milk and honey (2 Kings 18:24, 32). With God’s gold in their pockets they pridefully assume God’s place and hope to demoralize Hezekiah in the process.  

Distressed, Hezekiah returns to the temple. But this time it is not to rob it, but to pray (2 Kings 19:1, 14). Despite Hezekiah’s divided allegiances, God responds through the prophet Isaiah and promises that Israel will rise from its ashes in three years (2 Kings 19:28, 29). That same night 185,000 Assyrian soldiers die by God’s hand (2 Kings 19:35). But before Hezekiah can experience Israel’s renewal, he’s struck by a life-threatening illness (2 Kings 20:1). And unlike previous kings on their deathbed, he prays to God—and God promises to heal him in three days and extend his life by 15 years (2 Kings 20:5-6).

But true to his half-heartedness, these gifted years are used foolishly. Presumably to secure an alliance against Assyria, Hezekiah invites delegates from Babylon to tour Israel’s wealth (2 Kings 20:13). Isaiah calls out Hezekiah’s divided allegiances for what they are and announces that the nation he’s courting will plunder everything he’s shown them (2 Kings 20:17-18). 

Where is the Gospel?

Judah will fall into Babylon’s hands because they fail to trust God alone. And Hezekiah, as Judah’s king, embodied his nation’s divided allegiances. Jesus says we cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24). Hezekiah proves divided allegiances ultimately lead to death and exile.

Part of the message of Hezekiah is, “Don’t be like him!” Dividing your trust divides your rescue. You can not be half-saved. You are either dead or alive. Rescued or captive. At home or exiled. And God wants your undivided allegiance so that he can give you undivided and eternal life. Hezekiah tried to save his life by robbing the temple, but what he needed was a willingness to lose his life out of undivided loyalty to his God. It did Hezekiah no good to gain peace from his enemies because he lost his soul in the process (Matthew 16:25-26). Jesus promises to reward those willing to lose their lives with complete rescue and resurrection. Don’t be like Hezekiah!

But even more significant is that Hezekiah was spared because of promises God made to King David (2 Kings 19:34). Even when Hezekiah is divided, God is not. He was still wholeheartedly committed to the rescue of his people, despite centuries of unfaithfulness and Hezekiah’s own divided heart. Ultimately, salvation from enemies and of nations relies on God’s indivisible grace alone.

Sennacherib’s propaganda is wrong. No nation or idol can save. The only hope of Israel was and is God alone. Jesus has done battle with greater enemies than Assyria and rose from the dead three days later (1 Corinthians 15:4). Only the God of Israel revives on the third day! Jesus offers resurrection and life—even to the divided. Salvation comes from God alone and by grace alone.

Israel and Judah’s persistent idolatry is pushing God’s people towards inevitable spiritual, physical, and national death by Assyria’s hands.

In Israel, Jeroboam II is murdered by Zechariah, who six months later is assassinated by Shallum. One month later, Shallum is killed by Menahem. In an attempt to stabilize power and assuage Assyria’s landlust, Menahem levies extreme taxes from his people (2 Kings 15:20). This means that when his son inherits the kingdom, it’s drained of its wealth, and vulnerable to Pekah, the mutinous captain of his military (2 Kings 15:25). Pekah steals the throne but loses several strategic cities and tribal lands to the hungry Assyrians (2 Kings 15:29). Pekah’s failures lead Hoshea, Israel’s final king, to conspire and kill him (2 Kings 15:30). Still under pressure from Assyria, Hoshea tries to secure an alliance with Egypt. But it backfires (2 Kings 17:4). Assyria discovers the treachery, imprisons Hoshea, invades Israel, and carries the Israelites into exile (2 Kings 17:6). Hoshea means “salvation,” but Israel is damned under Hoshea’s idolatrous rule. 

During this same period of time Judah is only slightly better off. We’re told Amaziah, his son, and his grandson do right in God’s eyes, although not like their forefather David (2 Kings 14:3). All three of them tolerate similar idolatries and each pays a price for it (2 Kings 15:4, 35). Amaziah is assassinated, his son is leprous, and his grandson is plagued by conflict with Syria and Israel (2 Kings 14:19, 15:5, 37). When Amaziah’s next descendant Ahaz takes Judah’s throne, he’s the first king in decades to do evil in God’s eyes, and the first king in Judah’s history to sacrifice his son to a pagan god (2 Kings 16:2-3). Judah is on the same idolatrous death-march as Israel. 

Ahaz even strips God’s temple of its silver and gold to pay Assyrian mercenaries to attack Syria and Israel (2 Kings 16:7-8). Then, in symbolic deference to Assyria and her gods, Ahaz rapes the temple further and replaces the altar God designed with a copy of the Assyrian one (2 Kings 16:10-11, 17-18).

The record of this period of Israel’s history ends with an interpretation. Assyria carried off Israel because both Israel and Judah failed to fear, worship, and love God alone (2 Kings 17:7-8). On Mount Sinai God gave Israel ten commandments—and ten violations of those commandments are listed here. Israel has entirely turned away from the God of life. They prefer the idols of other nations, and so God leaves Israel to their spiritual, physical, and national death (2 Kings 17:22-23). 

Where is the Gospel?

In one sense Israel and Judah’s deaths were self-inflicted, but death is also God’s judgment. It wasn't a coincidence that the man named “salvation” is the one who destroyed Israel. It was God’s irony proving disobedience always brings death (Romans 6:23).  

But while both Israel and Judah are dead in their sins, God is rich in mercy and love towards his people. Earlier in Kings when a corpse was thrown into faithful Elisha’s grave, the Israelite man raised from the dead (2 Kings 13:21). And by the death of God’s faithful son Jesus, he will make his people alive once again (Ephesians 1:4-5).

If the story has always been disobedience leads to death, what happens when obedience leads to death like it did for Jesus (Philippians 2:8)? Just as it was hinted at with Elisha, the apostle Paul says that when the finally faithful Israelite King dies, he’s raised from the dead (Philippians 2:9). And at the name of Jesus (whose name, like Hoseha, also means salvation) every knee will bow to the true King of life, death, and the world (Philippians 2:10). 

There is no idol that brings life from the dead. There is no obedience to another god’s laws that will end our spiritual, physical, and national death. But when we bow—or better yet throw—ourselves into the tomb of King Jesus, we will rise (Romans 6:4). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who brings life from the dead. And may you see Jesus as the King whose name means salvation."

The book of Kings tells us more about God than it  tells us about Israel's history. God promised David an eternal dynasty and a kingdom that would not be undone by death or rebellion (2 Samuel 7:13). But David is on his deathbed and his kingdom is in crisis (1 Kings 1:1; 2:10). God’s promise of an eternal throne is at risk. Will God continue to be a God of life, even in death?

 David’s second-born son, Adonijah, revolts against David’s third-born son, Solomon (1 Kings 1:5). Adonijah is the heir apparent, but David had promised Solomon the throne (1 Kings 1:17). To legitimize his takeover Adonijah turns his father’s trusted general and priest to his side and invites his other royal brothers to a secret coronation (1 Kings 1:7, 9). But Solomon’s mother persuades David to force Solomon’s coronation early (1 Kings 1:11). David gives Solomon his royal donkey and crowns him king in Jerusalem. Solomon is anointed with oil by a priest loyal to the royal family (1 Kings 1:39). Adonijah is in the middle of his feast when he learns his coup has already failed (1 Kings 1:45-46). God’s promises won’t be undone by Adonijah, but will continue through Solomon. 

Fearing for his life, Adonijah rushes to the altar where priests offer sacrifices (1 Kings 1:50). In the book of Numbers, the altar was a place of asylum for people guilty of manslaughter (Numbers 35:25). Adonijah hopes Solomon will apply this law to his treason, and he does. Solomon’s first act as king is one of mercy. He forgives Adonijah’s treason and extends life to a traitor who deserves death (1 Kings 1:53). 

Where is the Gospel?

God brings life from the dead. David’s encroaching death, and Adonijah’s rebellion will not overthrow God’s plans for an eternal Davidic kingdom. Solomon’s ascension and Adonjiah’s failed rebellion are not just history but theology. God will bring life from David’s death through his son. And from Adonijah’s rebellion an eternal kingdom will be born.

In this way, David’s last days as king and Solomon’s first are less about a transition from one regime to another but about the coronation of David’s final son, Jesus. 

Jesus is the promised heir of Israel (Matthew 1:1). He’s anointed not with oil but with the Spirit (John 1:32). He rides into Jerusalem on a donkey (Mark 11:7). Like Solomon’s kingdom, Jesus’ Kingdom emerges from treacherous political drama, self-interest, and betrayal. Solomon’s Father, like God the Father, overturns the plots of sinful men to firmly install his Son on the throne (Acts 2:24). And Jesus begins his administration by forgiving his would-be executioners (Luke 23:34). Like Adonijah, anyone can come to Jesus. Both enemies and traitors can cling to his place of sacrifice and death and receive mercy and life.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God as the one who keeps his promises. And may you see Jesus as the King who brings life after death."

Israel is in the middle of a drought. It’s a natural disaster that mirrors the spiritual state of Israel and her kings. God’s word, like rain, brings life but Israel (and particularly King Ahab) have rejected God's words as their source of life (1 Kings 18:18, 16:30). The drought is a rebuke of Israel’s rejection of God’s life-giving word and so, only at the word of God’s prophet Elijah, will rain fall on Israel again (1 Kings 17:1). 

While the rest of Israel is hungry, God leads Elijah to a stream outside Israel’s borders and feeds him in the wilderness (1 Kings 17:2-3, 6). When the drought causes the stream to dry up, God promises a widow will feed him in a nearby town (1 Kings 17:9). When he arrives the drought has all but starved her (1 Kings 17:12). But at God’s word in Elijah's mouth, the widow’s food is multiplied and they both eat (1 Kings 17:16). 

Later, the widow’s son tragically dies (1 Kings 17:17). But in the first resurrection story in Scripture, the son is raised from the dead (1 Kings 17:22). God’s word in Elijah’s mouth brings life where everyone expected death (1 Kings 17:21). This poor foreign widow now sees what Israel’s most powerful monarch can’t—God’s word brings life (1 Kings 17:24).

So, God tells Elijah to confront Ahab and bring rain back to Israel (1 Kings 18:1). Elijah proposes a contest between Ahab’s false prophets and himself (1 Kings 18:23). The true God is whichever god responds to their sacrifices (1 Kings 18:24). For hours Ahab’s prophets beg Baal to respond, but no voice is ever heard (1 Kings 18:29). Elijah, on the other hand, does not beg. At his simple prayer, God speaks through fire (1 Kings 18:38). Unlike Baal, God is loud. 

Elijah kills the prophets who worshipped the silent god, and the God who speaks finally sends rain (1 Kings 18:40b, 45). When Ahab tells his wife Jezebel what Elijah has done, she threatens to kill him (1 Kings 19:2). Elijah barely escapes to the wilderness. But God meets him there and feeds him again (1 Kings 19:5-6). Then, like Moses, Elijah makes his way to Mt. Horeb, also known as Sinai (1 Kings 19:8). 

When God spoke to Moses it was through thunder and lightning—and Israel officially became God’s people through a covenant (Exodus 19:16). But now God’s people have abandoned that covenant and God speaks to Elijah in a whisper (1 Kings 19:12). But again God’s words bring life. God commissions Elijah to a new prophetic task (1 Kings 19:15-16a). And God tells Elijah that he is neither God’s last prophet nor the last faithful Israelite (1 Kings 19:16b, 18). God will yet bring life to dead Israel.  

Where is the Gospel?

Israel’s drought proves that rejecting God’s word invites death. Elijah’s miracles prove that God’s words bring life to the dead. In the beginning, God’s words brought light to darkness (Genesis 1:1). And the apostle John tells us that God’s life-giving Word has become flesh in Jesus (John 1:14). 

Jesus picks up the prophetic ministry of Elijah to bring life to the dead earth (Hebrew 1:1-2). Like Elijah, Jesus was fed in a wilderness, multiplied food to the starving, changed weather with a word, and is the only other man in Scripture to raise a widow’s son from the dead. Like Elijah, Jesus was also rejected by both Israel and her leaders (Luke 23:21). After Elijah’s rejection God comforted him with his still small voice. But after Jesus’ rejection God is silent (Mark 15:34).

God’s silence, like Israel’s drought, proves that rejecting God’s word invites death. But God’s Word in the flesh brings life even to tombs. Like the widow’s son, Jesus rises from the dead. Brighter than a pillar of fire and louder than whisper, the Word’s empty tomb proclaims loudly the good news of eternal life to all who take Jesus at his word.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God whose word brings life. And may you see Jesus as the Word made flesh who brings life to the whole world."

Israel is dying. In a visceral picture of the idolatry and failure of Israel’s leaders, a famine has starved the land (2 Kings 4:38). And a widow, unable to find justice from her king, goes to Elisha for help (2 Kings 4:2a). Debt collectors will soon force her sons into slavery unless the debt is paid (2 Kings 4:2b). Elisha tells her to borrow jars from her neighbors, take the little oil she has left, and pour it into the empty jars (2 Kings 4:4). Miraculously every empty vat in the village is filled with the oil in her small bottle (2 Kings 4:6). The widow is left with more than enough to pay off her debts and survive the famine (2 Kings 4:7). Israel is dying, but Elisha brings life to a home left for dead. 

A wealthy woman from the town of Shunem understands that Elisha’s ministry is unique (2 Kings 4:9). She builds him a room on the roof of her house and places a table, a chair, and a menorah (or a lamp) inside it (2 Kings 4:10). These are the same decorations used in the temple. They’re a sign that this Shunammite woman knows that God’s life-giving presence abides with Elisha. And in response to her generosity, Elisha prophesies that her dead womb will give birth to a son—and it does (2 Kings 4:17).

For years the family lives happily until the son tragically dies (2 Kings 4:20). She places his body in the rooftop temple and strangely doesn’t tell her husband that their son has died (2 Kings 4:21-22). She tells him that “all is well” and quickly sets off to find Elisha on Mt. Carmel (2 Kings 4:23-24a). Elisha’s servant Gehazi sees her from a distance and asks what’s wrong, only to get the same answer she gave to her husband: “All is well” (2 Kings 4:26). She only reveals her need to the man of God (2 Kings 4:28). She knows only God’s man can bring life. 

Elisha sends young Gehazi ahead with his staff to lay on the boy, but nothing happens (2 Kings 4:29). It’s only when God’s mobile temple—Elisha—touches the boy that he comes back to life (2 Kings 4:34). In Elisha, death does not take life, but life takes death.

We see this theme again as Elisha camps overnight in Gilgal. He and his men make a stew from wild gourds only to realize they’re poisonous (2 Kings 4:40). But the man of God takes the death out of the pot (2 Kings 4:41). And when his 100 men are hungry again, Elisha multiplies loaves of barley and grain, with leftovers to spare (2 Kings 4:44). 

Where is the Gospel?

Elisha was a walking, talking temple when Israel's temple was in shambles, and its leaders were corrupt. He brings life and relief wherever he goes because God is with him. In this way, Elisha’s ministry prepares us for Jesus. 

Jesus lived in a time when Israel's temple and leaders had become corrupt. Jesus knows he is a walking, talking temple. Like Elisha, Jesus multiplies food and raises the dead. He also heals the sick and cleanses lepers. Wherever he went life followed, and death was pushed back. Jesus was God’s life-giving presence in the flesh (John 1:14). He was the God-Man who could bring life. 

But more significantly than resuscitating a widow’s son who would one day die again, Jesus has risen from the dead never to die again. Like the Shunammite woman, we do not need to bring our death to anyone but Jesus. Because he lives forever, we know he will bring life-giving relief to any who ask for his presence.

King Jehu in Israel and King Joash in Judah are on mirrored paths. Both are secretly crowned (2 Kings 9:6; 11:3). Both their rules are announced by trumpets (2 Kings 9:13; 11:14). Both the monarchs they replace shout “treason!” before they’re killed (2 Kings 9:23; 11:14). And both Jehu and Joash tear down the houses of Baal (2 Kings 10:27; 11:18). Under these relatively faithful kings, both Israel and Judah experience a small revival from the long season of spiritual death they’ve known. 

Joash even brings some life back to God’s temple. The temple hadn’t been cared for in centuries, and Joash raises the funds to repair it (2 Kings 12:4-5). But the priests in charge are both incompetent and thieves (2 Kings 12:6-7). Spiritually dead, they steal from the temple’s repair fund, forcing Joash to keep the collection under armed guard (2 Kings 12:9). 

The Syrian king is uninterested in Judah’s revival and leads his army to Jerusalem (2 Kings 12:17). Desperate, Joash steals from the temple treasury just like his faithless priests and surrenders enough gold to ward off Syria’s attack (2 Kings 12:18). While it was common enough in the north, Joash becomes the first southern king to be assassinated by his own people (2 Kings 12:20). For all the revival Joash accomplishes, it does not stop his own death. 

While Joash was alive, Jehu passed away and two new kings sat on Israel’s northern throne. But both are evil and both are hounded by Syria (2 Kings 13:2, 11) and eventually ground to powder by Syria’s forces (2 Kings 13:7). Their failure to lead means Israel is on the verge of national death. 

But as if resurrected from the dead, Joash reappears in the narrative in a flashback. He’s with Elisha on his deathbed, and Elisha prophesies a limited run of three victories over Syria (2 Kings 13:14,19). Flashforward, Elisha dies and is placed in a grave. But when a dead man is thrown into Elisha’s tomb, he comes back to life (2 Kings 13:21). Both this actual resurrection and Joash’s sudden narrative resurrection are not-so-subtle clues that God will remain faithful to the promises he made to Israel, even in death (2 Kings 13:23).

Where is the Gospel?

We often think of the book of Kings as a book of history, but it’s more accurate to say that Kings is evangelistic. It’s a book about life from the dead. It reminds Israel of God’s promises and demonstrates through their macabre history that God’s faithfulness will last even beyond death. And at this point in Israel’s history everything is dying. 

The kings bring no lasting salvation. David’s kingly line is inseparable from the idolatrous line of Ahab. The temple is either in disrepair or plundered of its sacred objects. And now the prophets have all died. It’s significant that the author doesn’t remind Israel of God’s promise to David, but instead God’s ancient promise to Abraham (2 Kings 13:23). It’s as if the current political and religious system is so broken only the promises God made before Israel existed can bring hope. Back then nothing caused God to covenant with Abraham except his grace and mercy. And in the throes of death, not only Israel needs to know and believe this—it’s what we need to know and believe as well.

We are dying not just because we are mortal, but because every political, religious, and moral hope we’ve looked to for life has or will soon die. Our own family trees are inseparable from the injustice and idolatry of men like Ahab. Our religious institutions are crumbling into disrepair. Like Israel, we are beyond hoping for a return to some Davidic Golden Era. We must throw ourselves on God’s ancient, gracious promises if we hope to resurrect from these graves. 

God’s promises of mercy and life are available to us in Jesus. God made a covenant with his people before the world even began (Ephesians 1:4). He adopted us not because we earned it, but because he loves us (Ephesians 1:5). In grace and generosity he offers us in Jesus what was lost in a temple left to disrepair: redemption, forgiveness, and wisdom (Ephesians 1:6-8). And like the prophet Elisha, Jesus’ spent body and shed blood brings life from the dead. When we throw ourselves into his grave at our baptism, we unite ourselves to his resurrection life too (Romans 6:5). Like Israel we have died, but in Christ we rise from the dead.

Infamously wicked Ahab has died, and his son Jehoram has taken the throne. While he’s a marginal improvement on his father, Jehoram’s still at odds with God and his prophets (2 Kings 3:2). 

His father had annexed the neighboring nation of Moab and exacted steep taxes (2 Kings 3:4). But with Ahab dead, Moab’s king rebels (2 Kings 3:5). So Jehoram forms a coalition with Edom and Israel to march on Moab and quell the uprising (2 Kings 3:9a). But seven days into the march, there is no water for their troops or animals (2 Kings 3:9b). One member of the coalition believes God is trapping them—and in fact, he will very soon (2 Kings 3:10). But for now, at the coalition’s insistence, Jehoram seeks out a prophet for guidance (1 Kings 22:7, 2 Kings 3:11).

Providentially, Elisha is nearby. But concerned for the coalition, he also helps set God’s trap. Elisha prophesies that God will miraculously provide water in the wilderness and give Moab into their hands (2 Kings 3:17-18). But Elisha also predicts the coalition will cut down Moab’s trees, plug its rivers, and pollute its farmland (2 Kings 3:19). This is a prediction of disobedience. God’s law specifically forbids this type of scorched-earth warfare and comes with steep consequences (Deuteronomy 20:19). But these kings have forgotten this and don’t think to interpret this prophecy any further. God’s traps are set.

The next morning the desert fills with water (2 Kings 3:20). But the red sand and the desert sun make the miracle lake look like blood (2 Kings 3:22). The Moabites assume this means Israel’s fragile coalition has violently imploded, so they move to collect the spoil (2 Kings 3:23). But Israel and Edom are waiting, and the Moabites are easily ambushed (2 Kings 3:24). Israel marches on, fells Moab’s trees, and razes its farmland (2 Kings 3:25). Elisha’s prophecies have all come true. But the battle isn’t over. 

Cornered, Moab’s king burns his oldest son as a human sacrifice to his gods in hopes of a miraculous victory (2 Kings 3:27a). Moab’s gods don’t respond, but Israel’s God does. God attacks Israel and forces them to retreat (2 Kings 3:27b). What should have been an easy victory turns into a humiliating loss. Furious at the coalition’s selective hearing and neglect of his law, God uses Moab’s idolatry and infanticide to judge the ambitions of Ahab’s son. 

Where is the Gospel?

Jehoram is the second king in Ahab’s family to be humiliated by an under-interpreted and, therefore, misleading prophecy (1 Kings 22:22). It’s an uncomfortable thought that God can trap and trick not only his enemies but his people. It’s even more disconcerting to think that God’s prophet speaking God’s word doesn’t guarantee we know what God is up to. But a God of surprise endings is ultimately a good thing.

God is a God who upsets our expectations and turns things on their head. This isn’t because he’s malicious or because he enjoys watching people like Jehoram squirm (Ezekiel 33:11). No, God is good, loving, and life-giving. God wants the best for his people, but God is also a God of the unexpected. We should expect to be surprised by him.

We barely know what’s going on in our own lives, much less how to interpret our personal histories. But God's plans for us are as big as he is. God can do immeasurably more than we can ask or imagine (Ephesians 3:20). If God has not surprised you yet, perhaps you haven’t yet met God.

While God’s surprises in 2 Kings 3 serve to trap evil kings, the apostle Paul tells us that God works all things for our good, including unexpected suffering and painful misunderstandings (Romans 8:28). God will surprise the corrupt and wicked with their humiliation. But for those who love God, we will not be trapped by our sin but surprised by God’s loving and sacrificial care. 

Unlike the Moabite king who sacrificed his son to coerce the gods and save his people, Jesus is the Son of God who saves his people by freely sacrificing himself. Jesus’ death is not a manipulation of the divine but the self-humiliation of God so that forgetful, disobedient, and selectively-hearing people might be given surprising, unexpected, and undeserved victory. If nothing in your life is going the way you expect, trust that God will soon surprise you. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who sets traps for his enemies. And may you see Jesus as the one who surprises us with love, care, and victory over the grave."

David’s son Solomon has taken the throne. Immediately we’re told that Solomon loves the Lord (1 Kings 3:3a). And the Lord loves Solomon as well. As Solomon sacrifices 1,000 burnt offerings, God comes to him in a dream and says he will answer any request (1 Kings 3:5). Recognizing his own inexperience and immaturity, Solomon asks for wisdom and the ability to know the difference between good and evil (1 Kings 3:9).

God is thrilled with this request (1 Kings 3:10). He not only gives Solomon an unparalleled mind but everything he didn’t ask for—riches, honor, and a long life—provided he remains faithful to God’s law (1 Kings 3:12-14).

As soon as Solomon wakes from his dream, God’s wisdom is put to the test. A custody battle between two prostitutes is brought into Solomon’s court (1 Kings 3:16). Quickly Solomon realizes this case is just one woman’s word against another’s (1 Kings 3:23). He can never prove who is telling the truth based on their testimony. So, he threatens to cut the baby in two knowing that the real mother would never allow this to happen (1 Kings 3:27). In that moment, it’s apparent that God has granted Solomon’s request for wisdom. He’s wisely able to determine good from evil and bring justice to bear (1 Kings 3:28).

The kingdom seems to explode in response. Israel is “as numerous as the sand on the seashore” (1 Kings 4:20). That wording is taken from God’s promise to Abraham, and it’s the first time it is used as a description of Israel. That same phrase is also repeated to describe Solomon’s breadth of mind (1 Kings 4:29-30). God gives Solomon wisdom broad enough to rule the growing kingdom.  

Drawing on imagery from creation, Solomon’s wisdom is described seven times. He understands the beasts, birds, and trees (1 Kings 4:33). He has “dominion” over Israel like Adam did over Eden (1 Kings 4:24). And every family rests in peace under their own fig trees and grape vines (1 Kings 4:25). All the nations of the world come to be blessed by his wisdom (1 Kings 4:34). And Solomon makes plans to finally build God’s temple on the earth (1 Kings 5:5). Just as in the garden, man and God will walk together again! 

Where is the Gospel?

When Solomon asks for wisdom to know both good and evil, it's a reference to the garden of Eden. Adam was told not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:16). Since everything was “good” in the garden, there was no reason to know “evil.” But since Solomon lived in a world where not everything was good, and the line between good and evil was often blurred, he needed to know both. And once he did, Eden seemed to return. 

In a world after Eden only a wise King can bring us the blessing God promised Abraham and the peace and provision Adam and Eve knew. Like the wronged woman, we need a King who can see good and evil clearly and provide wise justice; not just when we’ve been wronged but when we don’t know what’s right. 

That wise King is Jesus. Like Solomon asked for wisdom and was given wealth and power, and like the woman asked for justice and was given a son, we look for wisdom in Jesus. Then we’re given a place in his eternal Kingdom and all the blessing and peace that comes with it (Matthew 6:33). And while we wait for Jesus’ Kingdom to come, our Bible contains the wisdom we need to know and do good works in an evil world (2 Timothy 3:16).

Jesus wants to rule wisely in our favor. So like both the wronged woman and Solomon, humble yourself before the wisdom of King Jesus and receive the justice and peace of a New Creation.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is wise. And may you see Jesus as God’s wise King who establishes a Kingdom of peace on the earth."

Years earlier, Elijah prophesied Israel in the north, Judah in the south, and their common enemy Syria would all experience a dramatic transfer of power (1 Kings 19:15-17). A new king strangles Syria’s old king in his sleep, and begins a brutal campaign against God’s people (2 Kings 8:15, 12). Meanwhile Israel and Judah are ruled by loyalists to Ahab and Jezebel, the old king and queen who murdered God’s prophets and replaced worship of God with worship of Baal (2 Kings 8:18, 27).

But like Elijah prophesied, Elisha anoints Jehu to be Israel’s new leader. He calls him a “messiah” (2 Kings 9:6). A messiah is a chosen savior for God’s people. The word literally means “anointed one.” Jehu is anointed to avenge the blood spilt by Ahab’s family (2 Kings 9:7-8), and he will reduce Jezebel to dog food (2 Kings 9:10). Jehu is the only northern king to be anointed, and when the people hear it they lay their clothes down at his feet and call him king (2 Kings 9:13).

Jehu then initiates seven acts of destruction against Ahab’s legacy and idolatry. On the same plot of land Ahab and Jezebel assassinated Naboth for a vineyard, both Israel and Judah’s Ahabic kings fall (2 Kings 9:24, 27). As Jehu approaches Jezebel, her servants throw her from her high tower. She’s trampled by horses, and dogs eat and excrete her over nearby fields (2 Kings 9:36-37). Elijah’s prophecy has come true again; Ahab’s line is dwindling.

Ahab's remaining descendants are concentrated in Samaria (2 Kings 10:1). Jehu sends letters to the leader of the city and encourages them to appoint one of Ahab’s sons to the throne (2 Kings 10:3). The leaders interpret this as a veiled threat and emphasize their fealty to Jehu over Ahab (2 Kings 10:4). Jehu then demands they bring the leaders (but he says “heads”) of Ahab’s sons to Jezreel (2 Kings 10:6). The leaders interpret this message literally, and decapitate 70 of Ahab’s sons (2 Kings 10:7). Like Elijah predicted, Jehu wipes out every loyalist to Ahab in Samaria (2 Kings 10:17).

The seventh and final act of destruction is against the Baal cult that Ahab and Jezebel introduced to Israel. On the threat of death, Jehu invites all the priests and prophets of Baal to a grand celebration and sacrifice to their false god (2 Kings 10:19). But it’s a trap. Jehu makes a show of sacrificing to Baal but locks the doors behind him, kills the revelers, and turns the temple into a sewer (2 Kings 10:25, 27). Jehu wipes out Baal from Israel and avenges those lost to Jezebel, Ahab, and their blood cult (2 Kings 10:28). 

Where is the Gospel?

In many ways Jehu is a flawed messiah for Israel (2 Kings 10:29) and he will fail to push back the brutality of Syria’s king as a result (2 Kings 10:32). But he is the only northern king to roll back Israel’s idolatry. He’s also the only northern king who does “right” in God’s eyes. And shockingly his vengeance is proof that, like David, he is a king after God’s own heart (2 Kings 10:30). 

As a messiah, Jehu shows us that vengeance against the wicked, particularly vengeance against those who attack God’s prophets, is part of God’s heart. In a parable directed at the religious elite and Pharisees, Jesus says the same. Opponents of God’s prophet will be broken to pieces by a coming Anointed One, a coming Messiah (Matthew 21:44-45).

Jesus is a new Jehu. Jesus is the final avenger against powers and religions that steal from the poor, murder God’s prophets, and promote a destructive spirituality. Only king Jehu and King Jesus walk on the freely-offered clothes of their citizens (Luke 19:35-36). And both do so on the warpath against temples dedicated to false gods in Israel (Matthew 21:13). Jehu’s vengeance failed to right Israel’s idolatries, but Jesus’ vengeance will not. 

In the book of Revelation, Jezebel reappears as a false teacher (Revelation 2:20). And the figure of an idolatrous woman stained with the blood of God’s people and prophets is a frequent theme (Revelation 17:6). The Bible understands that the conflict between Jehu and Jezebel is not over. The powerful, the corrupt religious elite, and murderous worldviews are all “Jezebels.” They’re still deceiving, threatening, and killing God’s people. But Jesus is coming to avenge the blood spilt by the idolatrous and the powerful. Like Jehu, Jesus’ clothes will drip with the blood of the evil and the violent (Revelation 19:13). Jesus will leave no idolatry unavenged (Revelation 19:2). And all God’s people who have been oppressed will live in peace forever.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who avenges evil. And may you see Jesus as a greater Jehu who wipes out all evil and corrupt religion, giving his people peace."

Near death, David hands over the kingdom to his son Solomon. His last words to Solomon use God’s history with Israel as a template to give Solomon advice for ruling well. 

Like God created the world in seven days, David tells Solomon seven times to keep God’s commands (1 Kings 2:3). This is how Solomon’s nation will bless the world and fulfill God’s promise to Abraham (Genesis 12:2-3). David also reminds Solomon of God’s promise to Moses. Israel will prosper if Solomon obeys the Law (1 Kings 2:4). Finally, David tells Solomon he needs to be strong and courageous like Joshua if he’s to recreate God’s Kingdom on the earth (1 Kings 2:2, Joshua 1:6).

This high calling is why David’s final words to Solomon also include unfinished business from his reign. Joab, his general, committed murder but was never convicted (1 Kings 2:5b). Shimei, a loyalist to Saul, slandered and attempted to stone David but was never brought to justice (1 Kings 2:8). And Barzillai had not yet been honored for his loyalty to David during Absalom’s rebellion (1 Kings 2:7). David wants Solomon to tie up these loose threads and start his reign with a clean slate. 

David dies (1 Kings 2:10), and Adonijah (Solomon’s brother) sees another chance to seize the throne through a strategic political marriage (1 Kings 2:17). Solomon realizes his treachery, executes his brother, and exiles the priest who helped him (1 Kings 2:25). Solomon is free from his own entanglements and can now complete his father’s dying wishes. 

Solomon delivers the death penalty to Joab (1 Kings 2:34). And he offers Shimei the same mercy he extended to Adonijah. Solomon adapts one of Moses’ laws about manslaughter to Shimei (Numbers 35:9-11). He will not punish Shimei for his treason as long as he remains under house arrest in Jerusalem (1 Kings 2:37). But Shimei disregards this mercy and forces Solomon to execute him (1 Kings 2:46). The death that Shimei wished on David now comes back on his own head. With these loose ends tied up, Solomon’s reign can now begin. 

Where is the Gospel?

David had extremely high hopes for his son. He sees him as a new Adam who recreates the world, a new Moses who interprets and applies God’s law for a new generation, and a new Joshua who protects their homeland. It seems as if God’s promise that one of David’s sons would rule forever might come true in Solomon (2 Samuel 7:13). But it won’t. There are flaws in Solomon’s leadership and we’ll talk about those soon. 

But for now, Solomon shows us in part what Jesus will be in full. Jesus is the new Adam who destroys the old and makes us into new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17). Jesus is our new Moses who interprets and applies God’s law to our hearts (Matthew 5:38-39). Jesus is the final courageous Joshua who conquers our enemies (1 Corinthians 15:55-57). And Jesus is not just a biological heir to David’s throne but a true spiritual successor who establishes his Kingdom by executing justice for sins long left unpunished (Romans 3:25). 

But the good news of Jesus’ Kingdom is that even though we are traitors like Adonijah, murderers like Joab, and slanderers like Shimei, our sin does not come back on our own heads. It lands on Jesus. Jesus’ blood is shed for the treachery and slander we’ve committed against his throne. And since our sin has been wiped away, we are free to live in God’s Kingdom forever.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who establishes his Kingdom with justice. And may you see Jesus as the last son of David who rules forever."

Solomon’s nation has been established, his palace is complete, the temple has been built, and God’s presence has descended into it (1 Kings 9:3). But Solomon is in danger; he is misusing the wisdom God gave him. God warns that continued misuse of his gifts will lead to Israel’s destruction (1 Kings 9:6-7).

But cracks are starting to form. Hiram is the king of Tyre and helped fund Solomon’s temple with over four tons of gold. But he is displeased (1 Kings 9:14). In return for Hiram’s role in his rise to power, Solomon gives Hiram 20 towns. But Hiram calls the gifted region “Kabul,'' which is a play on the word “worthless” (1 Kings 9:13). 

Solomon then repeats the failures of Israel when they first entered their promised land (Judges 1:28). Instead of driving out God’s enemies, he marries the Egyptian Pharaoh's daughter and enslaves his own people (1 Kings 9:15, 20-21). Ironically, Solomon’s Egyptian father-in-law is the king who obeys God’s commands making Solomon look more like the Pharaoh Israel escaped from than the actual Pharaoh of Egypt (1 Kings 9:16). Solomon even builds “store cities” like the ones Israel was forced to build (1 Kings 9:19; Exodus 1:11) and imports Egyptian horses and chariots (1 Kings 10:28).  

These aren’t just concerning parallels. In Deuteronomy, God specifically forbade Israel’s kings from acquiring Egyptian horses (Deuteronomy 17:16). Israel was supposed to have nothing to do with the trappings of that old empire including amassing silver and gold. This is yet another crack in Solomon’s obedience (Deuteronomy 17:17, 1 Kings 10:21).

Solomon is using his God-given wisdom to break God’s commands. But at the same time, God is also using Solomon’s wisdom to bless the nations around him. A visiting queen from Sheba is left breathless at Solomon’s wisdom and wealth (1 Kings 10:5). Significantly, this foreign queen worships God as a result (1 Kings 10:8). Despite Solomon’s increasingly apparent foolishness, this queen is converted by seeing God’s wisdom in the flesh. 

Where is the Gospel?

There are no perfect characters in the Bible apart from Jesus. But Solomon, so far, represents the closest Israel has been to restoring what was lost in the Garden. It’s devastating to realize the wisdom Solomon asked for—to “know both good and evil” (1 Kings 3:9)—will end the same way it did for Adam when he reached for fruit from the tree of “knowledge of good and evil” (Genesis 3:5). Adam’s sin destroyed the world, and Adam’s sons built the oppressive empires that enslaved Israel. Solomon isn’t restoring the Garden, he’s reenacting the curse that comes with knowing both good and evil. He’s misusing God’s wisdom refusing to obey and leading Israel to death.

But Jesus is a better King than Solomon. Jesus tells us so (Luke 11:31)! He even says that we will all see the Queen of Sheba when Jesus returns, and she will judge those who do not recognize Jesus’ kingly wisdom. Like the queen worshiped God when she saw Solomon’s flawed wisdom and wealth, we should worship God when we see Jesus’ flawless wisdom. Jesus’ wisdom was not proved by wealth, political alliances, or horses. Rather, Jesus' wisdom was shown in his weakness (1 Corinthians 1:25). That’s because weakness is more powerful than wisdom. Yes, Solomon’s wisdom earned him a kingdom, but Jesus’ weakness gained resurrection from the dead. 

Like the queen of Sheba, we can look at Jesus’ cross and see a greater spectacle of wisdom than Solomon’s throne (1 Corinthians 1:23-24). And like the queen of Sheba, if we worship God because of this wisdom, we will be raised from the dead and placed in a Kingdom that cannot end. Jesus' Kingdom is not built on the backs of slaves but by the wounds on his own back. In Jesus, the curse that Adam began and Solomon could not undo is finally reversed.

Ahab’s evil line is coming to an end, but so is the prophet Elijah’s ministry (2 Kings 2:1) 

Ahab’s son Ahaziah is badly wounded and sends a messenger to ask Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron if he’ll recover (2 Kings 1:2). But God sends Elijah to intercept Ahaziah’s men (2 Kings 1:3). Wearing nothing but a cloak made of hair and a leather belt, he tells them that Ahaziah will die for his failure to inquire of the God who lives in Israel (2 Kings 1:6, 8).

Enraged, Ahaziah sends two troops of 50 men to capture Elijah (2 Kings 1:9). Each cries out, “Man of God...Come down” (2 Kings 1:9b). The Hebrew word for “man” is very similar to the Hebrew for “fire.” So Elijah says that in response to their threats and disbelief, the fire of God will come down—and it does on the first two troops of Ahaziah’s men (2 Kings 1:10). But a third battalion asks for mercy and is spared (2 Kings 1:13). Ahaziah dies shortly after knowing mercy was only an ask away (2 Kings 1:17). 

Soon Elijah will die and leave Elisha to continue his prophetic opposition against Ahab and Israel’s idolatry (1 Kings 19:19). Together they travel from Bethel to Gilgal and then to Jericho; each a significant location in Joshua’s succession of Moses. And in each, Elijah offers Elisha the opportunity to refuse his prophetic mantle, but he won’t (2 Kings 2:6). 

Groups of false prophets try to taunt Elisha away from this calling by jeering that Elisha will have no “head” or leader to protect him (2 Kings 2:3, 5). As a threat, they gather in a troop of 50 by the Jordan River (2 Kings 2:7). Meanwhile, like Moses and Joshua, Elijah parts the waters of the Jordan with his cloak. And Elisha asks God for a doubling of Elijah’s anointing (2 Kings 2:8-9). Immediately, Elijah is caught in a whirlwind and ascends to heaven, leaving his cloak (2 Kings 2:11). Elisha wears it as Elijah’s successor and asks the taunting prophets, “Where now is the Lord?” The implied answer is in Israel and with Elisha.

Elisha proves this by parting the Jordan himself (2 Kings 2:14). Unlike Joshua, who parted the river and destroyed Jericho, Elisha heals the enemy city (2 Kings 2:21). And when a new group of young men taunts Elisha for having no “hair” on his “head” (which is an innuendo about how Elijah and his “hairy” robe was used to protect Elisha), bears come out of the woods to maul them (2 Kings 2:24). Like fire fell from the sky to vindicate Elijah, God proves Elisha is Elijah’s successor and is protected by Israel’s God himself. 

Where is the Gospel?

This is one of many stories of succession in Scripture where the next generation is greater than the first. Moses led Israel to the borders of their promised land, but Joshua conquered and settled it. Elijah performed powerful miracles, but Elisha has twice his anointing and will do almost double his miracles (2 Kings 2:9). Again, at the Jordan River, John the Baptist said of Jesus, his successor, “he must become greater; I must become less” (John 3:30). And Jesus’s ministry didn’t just wash people as a sign of repentance but bathed them with God’s Spirit (Matthew 3:11).

You and I are also successors. When Jesus, like Elijah, ascended to heaven, the mantle of his authority was passed on to his disciples (Acts 1:8-9). And like Joshua and Elisha, by his Spirit, we will do greater things than our predecessor Jesus (John 14:12). His anointing is not doubled but tripled, quadrupled, and billion-dupled with every believer on the planet. And while Joshua and Elisha got a taste of God’s Spirit, we are filled by God’s Spirit (John 14:20).

God has not left us alongside unconquered borders, among jeering rulers, and in an evil world without a dose of his anointing. Just as Joshua, Elijah, and Jesus all passed through the waters of the Jordan and saw God was in Israel with them, we will pass through the waters of baptism and will know God is with us wherever we are. This is not because we ascend to heaven or because bears maul our enemies or doves rest on our shoulders (Matthew 3:16), but because the tomb is empty. 

With Elisha, we can stand in Israel over Jesus’ empty grave and ask a taunting world, “Where now is the Lord?” Knowing that Jesus has mauled death like a bear, and his Spirit has fallen like fire on us. 

So, as new Joshuas and Elishas, we go into a hostile world unafraid. Our predecessor has overcome the world, and his help is only an inquiry away. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God of Israel who is with his people. And may you see Jesus as your predecessor, who has filled you with His Spirit to overcome the world."

Israel’s monarchy will not bring God’s Kingdom. Solomon, Israel’s most powerful king, is dead. Now, God’s people are left in the middle of an inverted Exodus story where Israel is now Egypt.

At Solomon’s death, his son inherits the kingdom. But a rival leader named Jeroboam returns from Egypt to save God’s people (1 Kings 12:1-2). Many in Israel were enslaved under Solomon’s rule and now look to Jeroboam for relief (1 Kings 12:3-4). Like Pharaoh, Solomon’s son responds to this threat by increasing the slaves’ workload (1 Kings 12:14, Exodus 5:9). Like Moses, Jeroboam leads ten of Israel’s tribes out of slavery and into the wilderness north of Jerusalem (1 Kings 12:19). But as soon as they’re free, Jeroboam builds new golden calves and tells Israel, “Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt” (1 Kings 12:28). Israel’s history has repeated itself except Israel is the oppressor, and the man from Egypt is the liberator.

Regardless, a prophet confronts Jeroboam and prophesies that a new king, Josiah, will end his idolatrous cult (1 Kings 13:2). As signs to prove his message is from God, God withers Jeroboam’s hand, and his false altar splits in two (1 Kings 13:4-5). But Jeroboam is stubborn and hard-hearted. He rebuilds the golden calves and paves the way for his dynasty’s destruction (1 Kings 14:10).

Then, in an inversion of the Passover, Jeroboam's son is sick and he sends his wife to a prophet for healing (1 Kings 14:1). But while she is still in the prophet’s doorway, he prophesies the deaths of both the boy and Jeroboam (1 Kings 14:9,12). Like the firstborn sons of Egypt, as soon as she steps on her own doorstep her son dies (Exodus 12:23; 1 Kings 14:17). 

Meanwhile Solomon’s son, in the other half of the divided kingdom, sets up his own idols and is plundered by the Egyptians (1 Kings 14:23, 25). It’s the exact reverse of Israel’s plunder of Egypt’s wealth in the days after the Passover (Exodus 12:36). And both sides in Israel’s civil war learn the same thing: idolatry leads to slavery, loss, and death.

Where is the Gospel?

Solomon’s son and Jeroboam prove that a crown is not enough to lead Israel out of their idolatrous preferences. Like their ancestors, Israel just wants to do what’s right in their own eyes (1 Kings 14:8). And for Israel, the consequence of doing evil in God’s eyes is going back to slavery (1 Kings 14:16). Ironically, Jeroboam was the master of Israel’s slaves under Solomon. Israel trusts a slaver to liberate them and ends up enslaved to new masters and new idols, and death.

Idols and images always lead to slavery. Both golden calves and images of an ideal and fulfilled life promise liberation, but turn out to be slavers. We sacrifice our relationships, our hopes, and our morality to what looks right in our own eyes but find ourselves just as trapped as before. We’re still stuck in our own inverted Exodus enslaved by what we thought was right (John 8:34). 

We don’t need an idol, we need God to liberate us. And God has shown himself, not as an image carved from wood or molded from gold, but born in the flesh. Jesus is the exact image of God and the living imprint of his nature (Hebrews 1:3). Israel hoped Josiah would liberate them. But Jesus is not only Josiah’s son but God’s--and those whom Jesus sets free are free forever (John 8:36). 

Instead of making your own sacrifices to false gods, hopes, and idols, trust that Jesus is both your God and your sacrifice. He died as a Passover lamb to invert the story of your idolatry and death. By his blood on the doors of your heart, he liberates you from slavery to sin. And by his resurrection, Jesus inverts the grave and plunders death of its power (1 Corinthians 15:55). Jesus is the only image worth bowing to. Trust him alone, and he will set you free.

God has appeared to Solomon twice so far, and each time God gives the same warning (1 Kings 3:14, 9:4-5). If Solomon walks in the Lord’s ways, like his father David, God will continue to grow and establish his kingdom. And so far, Solomon’s reign has been glorious. Israel is at the height of its cultural and military dominance. Solomon seems to be like his father, and Israel has thrived as a result. 

But Solomon is not like his father (1 Kings 11:6). Solomon has collected 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3). Some could argue (not that you should) that a harem like this is just wise statecraft. These women represent political alliances and Solomon’s shrewd consolidation of Mespotamian power. But however wise politically, God had already warned how foolish this is spiritually (1 Kings 11:2). In his old age Solomon ends up prostituting himself before the abominable gods of the nations around him (1 Kings 11:7). So God keeps his promise, withdraws his blessing and tells Solomon the kingdom will be stripped from his family’s hand and given to someone else (1 Kings 11:11). 

We’re then given the origin stories of three new enemies—Hadad from Edom, Rezon a Gentile, and Jeroboam an Israelite. They will plague Solomon’s later years and one day overthrow his son. Jeroboam represents the most serious threat. He already has significant power in Solomon’s kingdom (1 Kings 11:28). And one of God’s prophets, Ahijah, prophesies that he will be the one to rip ten tribes from under Solomon’s son’s rule (1 Kings 11:31). 

God even gives the same promise to Jeroboam that he gave to Solomon. If Jeroboam obeys God, like David did, his nation will be as great as his grandfather’s (1 Kings 11:38). So Solomon tries to assassinate him but fails. Jeroboam seeks asylum in Egypt (1 Kings 11:40). Solomon then dies, having failed not only to walk in God’s commands but also to to stop the prophesied end of his family’s dynasty and the beginning of a civil war (1 Kings 11:43).

Where is the Gospel?

Solomon’s life and death foreshadow both the rest of the book of Kings and the rest of Israel’s history. The foreign enemies God raises against Solomon are the forefathers of the nations of Assyria and Babylon. And Jeroboam's rebellion will divide Israel for the rest of her history. Even Jesus is opposed by the same three nations mentioned here. Herod is an Edomite, the Romans are Gentiles, and the scribes and Pharisees are Jewish. Solomon’s failures have set the pattern that Israel is doomed to repeat.

The rest of the book of Kings tells story after story of Israel marrying forbidden spouses, worshipping idols that are abominations, and dividing further from one another and from the Lord. So God keeps his promise to Solomon. He withdraws his blessing, strips Israel’s kingdom bare, and hands them over to Assyria (1 Kings 11:11). 

But because of David’s faithfulness to God, God promised David that one of his sons would rule forever (2 Samuel 7:12). That promise hasn’t been overturned; it’s why both Solomon and his son are told to act like David (1 Kings 11:6, 38). Israel’s fate hangs on the promise of a son of David who is even greater than his father. But that son is not Solomon, it’s Jesus. 

Unlike Solomon, Jesus followed the example of his father (John 5:19). Unlike Solomon, Jesus doesn’t use his wisdom to consolidate power but to give his power away (1 Corinthians 1:23-24). So unlike Solomon’s death that sealed the division of his kingdom and the death of his dynasty, Jesus’ death inaugurated an eternal Kingdom and a united family of God. 

Jesus is the King we’ve been waiting for. We don’t need to be afraid. Our kingdom isn’t on the verge of collapse; we have a citizenship in heaven that can’t be undone by politics (Philippians 3:20). Our nation is secure and the enemies that once threatened us, like Edom and the Gentiles once threatened Israel, can now be counted as brothers and sisters by the power of Jesus’ rule (Ephesians 2:11-12). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God as our only true King. And may you see Jesus as the final Son of David whose Kingdom lasts forever and who makes our enemies into our family."

When we stretch out our hands to him, all the blessings of Eden and God's temple are given to us.",Website,1 & 2 Kings Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Solomon builds the temple. It’s the highest point in Israel’s history because the temple is more than a place of worship. It’s a model of the universe as it’s meant to be. Like Eden, it was a place where God and man could live together. Moses was told that God’s tabernacle is a copy of a heavenly one (Exodus 25:40; Hebrews 8:5). 

The gold, the cedar, and the placement of the temple’s sacred decorations all represent the way God wants his universe to be ordered. Like the garden, it’s lush with gourds, pomegranates, and lilies (1 Kings 6:18; 1 Kings 7:42). Every element is expertly designed and engineered (1 Kings 6:7). God’s throne and presence sit in the middle of this temple-universe and affect anyone who gets close (1 Kings 8:10-11). The Presence is even guarded by two angels like the two that guarded Eden (1 Kings 6:27; Genesis 3:24). And the temple is full of water just like each inch of the Garden was watered. 

There’s a giant bowl called the “Sea” and as you walk towards God’s presence, you’re flanked by ten giant basins of water (1 Kings 7:39, 43). Like Israel went through the Red Sea to meet God at the mountain, God’s people will relive their salvation story as they walk towards his presence. The temple is a mini-model of the universe. 

This is why Solomon’s own palace, along with his throne room, and Israel’s Supreme Court are all built nearby and with the same Edenic imagery as the temple (1 Kings 7:2). Humanity was supposed to rule the earth with God, so Solomon places his palace, throne, and judgment seat next to God.

God warns Solomon that he’s not confined to this temple (1 Kings 6:13). And when Solomon dedicates the temple, he warns his people with the same truth (1 Kings 8:27). God wasn’t waiting for a building before he could dwell with his people; he dwells with hearts that love and desire to obey him (1 Kings 8:25). God didn’t need a temple, but his people needed a symbol to remind them that whoever stretches out their hands to Him will receive all the riches of Eden (1 Kings 8:30). This is the universe as it is meant to be.

Where is the Gospel?

The Apostle John tells us that Jesus understood his death as a destruction of the old ways of worshiping God and the beginning of the reign of a new kind of temple (John 2:19-21). Ultimately, Jesus is the temple and model for how the universe is meant to be. When people stretched out their hands to him, they were healed (Mark 5:27-28). When people asked to be forgiven (and even when they didn’t), Jesus approached them and forgave their sins. (Mark 2:5). 

No longer would the people have to go to the temple and receive forgiveness of sins and healing. In Jesus, the temple would come to them. John says that Jesus “tabernacled” among us, although your Bible probably translates that word as “dwelling” (John 1:14). Jesus’ life brought the garden of Eden near to all those who asked. As the new center of the universe, he represents the way we approach God’s presence and power. Just as Israel passed through the symbolic waters in the temple, we pass through the blood of Jesus’ cross. We are granted access that is not temporary but instead assures us eternal life with God.

But we are also temples (1 Corinthians 6:19). We are new and living models of a universe set right. Like Solomon and Adam and Eve, we rule alongside God as God rules inside of us. Wherever we go we become outposts of a Kingdom and seedlings of the Garden. Peter calls us living stones of a new temple (1 Peter 2:5). Paul says we are God’s living building that, brick by brick, communicates the reality and presence of God’s Kingdom (1 Corinthians 3:9-10). More beautiful than the temple, you have been designed, like each part of God’s garden, to be a part of his good plan to remake the world. 

See for Yourself

So may the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who lives in his temple. And may you see Jesus as the one who makes us into new temples and partners with us in his good rule over all the earth."

Elijah prophesied that Ahab’s dynasty would come to a grisly end (1 Kings 21:21). And now his son Joram will experience it firsthand. Besieged by Syria, Israel is in the middle of a man-made famine (2 Kings 6:25). Powerless, Joram takes a walk along the city wall and sees a woman who is starving and crying out for relief and justice (2 Kings 6:26). She had made a deal with another woman to boil and eat her own son if on the following day they would eat the other woman’s son (2 Kings 6:28). But the second woman hasn’t gone through with it and the first woman wants the king to enforce her cannibalistic barter (2 Kings 6:29). Joram rips his clothes in grief, blames Elisha for the death, famine, and war in Israel, and dispatches an assassin to kill Israel’s prophet (2 Kings 6:31). 

This is foolish. Joram wants to kill the man who has raised a boy from the dead, fed a starving woman, and helped Israel avoid multiple bloody conflicts with Syria. Everything Joram is grieving is available from the God whom Elisha serves. He’s just too blind to see it. We expect this type of hard-heartedness to receive swift judgment. But when Elisha’s men stop Joram’s hitman, he tells him that God will end the famine overnight (2 Kings 7:1). Ahab’s dynasty will not end until it experiences even more of God’s mercy, which four lepers unexpectedly discover. 

Knowing there was no food in Israel, the lepers decide to beg from their Syrian besiegers and make the long walk to their camp (2 Kings 7:4). But the enemy camp is empty (2 Kings 7:5). While Joram was sleeping, God attacked the Syrians with the sounds of an oncoming army and they retreated (2 Kings 7:7). These lepers become the first in Israel to taste relief from their famine (2 Kings 7:8). They go to the king and tell him the good news (2 Kings 7:9). Their enemies have been shamed by God in the night and God has prepared a banquet in their enemy’s camp. True to his blindness, Joram doubts the lepers' testimony (2 Kings 7:12). But Israel’s famine is over just as Elisha predicted and Ahab’s son is shown mercy (2 Kings 7:16).   

As this story began, so it ends, with another woman requesting justice from Joram (2 Kings 8:3). And it’s Gehazi, Elisha’s faithless and leprous former servant, who relays the request to Joram (2 Kings 8:5). He informs Joram this is the same woman whose son Elisha raised from the dead. In response to this leper’s testimony and the work of God’s life-giving prophet, Joram rules in the woman’s favor (2 Kings 8:6). For now, the king has changed, and God has prepared a banquet in famine and given justice to this woman.

Where is the Gospel?

The book of Kings was written to encourage Jews in exile to find relief and justice in God’s word and God’s prophet. Three times people outside the walls of Israel’s last city can find no relief or justice in their king. Joram leaves the women to eat their young, and the lepers would rather throw themselves on the mercy of their enemies than rely on the justice of their king. Consistently, it’s Elisha and his words that bring life and justice. At Elisha’s words, hunger ends for the women and the lepers. And it’s only Gehazi’s testimony of Elisha’s words that inches Joram towards justice. Relief and justice are found in God’s words in the mouth of God’s prophet. 

If Israel wants her sons raised from the dead, if she wants healing from her leprosy, if she wants salvation from starvation, if she wants justice, if she wants to return to her land after exile, she must listen to God’s words in the mouth of God’s prophet. 

Eventually Elisha, the prophet who brought justice, life, and relief, will die. This leaves Israel to become less and less sympathetic to God’s words and God’s prophets. Israel will eventually die, too, exiled into enemy lands. Stories like this were written to encourage exiled Jews that life from the dead was still possible. And in Jesus, it is.

Like Elisha Jesus healed lepers, fed families, and raised sons from the dead. But Jesus is greater than Elisha because Jesus brings an end to Israel’s exile and an end to death forever (Hebrews 1:2). God’s final prophet rises from the grave and rules from an eternal throne over all the earth forever. We cannot be exiled because the whole earth is his kingdom. Unlike Joram, we can come to Jesus and expect justice and power. He is not helpless in the face of our starvation, sickness, cannibalism, and death. He gives life, justice, and mercy to all who ask.

So don’t appeal to your king. Come and appeal to Jesus, the final Prophet, and receive life.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who gives his people a prophet. And may you see Jesus as the final prophet of God who brings life to all people."

The evil of Ahab’s dynasty and his bloody war with Syria exist alongside Elijah and Elisha’s prophetic ministries. As prophets they are living symbols of life and freedom in an era ruled by evil and oppression. Without exception each of the miracles they perform—even a miracle about a floating axe head—proclaim good news to Israel’s oppressed while indicting Israel’s oppressive kings. 

While building a home for their prophetic community, one of Elisha’s men loses a borrowed axe head to the river (2 Kings 6:5). Earlier in Elisha’s ministry, a widow almost sold her sons over a debt of oil (2 Kings 4:1). Losing an iron axe will almost certainly result in slavery, especially when the kings have allowed Israel’s slave-trade to thrive. So Elisha reverses gravity and the axe floats to the surface. This is no a petty miracle, but proof that God will dramatically reverse oppression and deliver him from his slavery (2 Kings 6:6).

But Elisha isn’t just fighting Ahab’s dynastic cruelty within Israel; he’s fighting Syria’s aggression against Israel too. God gives Elisha some prophetic intel into Syria’s battle plans, which he delivers to Israel (2 Kings 6:9). Consistently defeated, Syria's king realizes Elisha is the supernatural mole, and sends an entire battalion to seize him (2 Kings 6:14). But God surrounds Syria’s troops with an army of his own and blinds every last soldier (2 Kings 6:17-18). With no other choice, the blind army follows God’s prophet to the king of Israel who wants to massacre these prisoners of war (2 Kings 6:20-21).

But God restores their sight and Elisha demands the king of Israel set a feast for these soldiers and set the captives free (2 Kings 6:23). Elisha is not just a mole, he embodies and enacts the salvation God wants to provide for Israel by saving her enemies. God saves the blind Syrian army to indict Israel’s king for his failure to see God’s salvation and freedom in Elijah and Elisha. Israel would be saved if only they had the eyes to see.

Where is the Gospel?

Elisha’s miracles are both declarations of good news to Israel and indictments of Israel. God is bringing freedom and salvation, even to the Syrians. If Israel will follow the voice of the prophet, their debts will be paid, their blind eyes will be opened, and they will be freed.

Like Elisha’s ministry and miracles, Jesus’ ministry and miracles are more than demonstrations of power; they’re prophecies of good news for the oppressed of Israel, while at the same time indictments against those who have rejected God.

Jesus’ healing of a Roman centurion declares that healing power is available to all who have faith, but it’s also a judgment on Israel’s lack of faith (Luke 7:9). When prostitutes and tax collectors feast at Jesus’ table, it’s an invitation for us to admit our brokenness and sickness as much as it is an invitation to rejoice that God accepts the outsider (Luke 5:30-31). When Jesus heals a blind man, it’s not just a powerful declaration of good news to the blind; it’s also judgment on those who claim they can see (John 9:7, 41). In a story very similar to the lost axe, Peter owes taxes and Jesus says he’ll find the money in a fish’s mouth (Matthew 17:27). Like the lost axe, the metal coins are drawn to the surface and his debt is paid for. This is not just a demonstration of Jesus' power, but proof that God delivers us from the debts we owe if we are willing to listen and have eyes to see.

Israel in Elisha’s day, the religious leaders in Jesus’ day, and most everyone every day dismiss God’s prophet and his prophetic signs. We either limit them to displays of power or—even worse—dismiss their prophetic dimensions. But if we admit we are blind and follow the voice of God’s prophet Jesus, our debts will be paid in full, our blind eyes will be opened, we will be set free from our captors, and we will enjoy a feast in the presence of our enemies. So follow the voice of Jesus and see for yourself.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has sent his prophet. And may you see that none of Jesus’ miracles are petty, but both declarations of his good news and invitations to repent."

King Ahab is at war with God, his prophets, and Syria. God confronted, humiliated, and killed Ahab’s false prophets on Mt. Carmel. Elijah has withheld rain from Israel’s drought-parched land. And Syria, along with a coalition of 32 kings, have demanded Ahab’s surrender. Rather than engage in a battle he’s likely to lose, Ahab temporarily yields (1 Kings 20:3-4). Overconfident in his victory, Syria’s king Ben-Hadad changes the terms of surrender at the last moment (1 Kings 20:6). But with nothing left to lose, Ahab refuses Syria’s offer. Both sides prepare for war (1 Kings 20:9, 12). 

An unnamed prophet tells Ahab that God will win this battle and show him that he is the Lord (1 Kings 20:13). Outnumbered, Ahab ambushes and defeats his opponents, but Ben-Hadad escapes (1 Kings 20:20-21). He’s convinced that Israel won the battle because their God is god of the mountains only, and so he plans next year’s battle on the plains (1 Kings 20:23). But a prophet tells Ahab that God will not only prove he’s the “God of the plains” to Ben-Hadad’s forces, but prove himself as the Lord of all the earth to Ahab (1 Kings 20:28). 

In a stunning victory God repeats the miracle he performed for Joshua in Jericho (Joshua 6:16). After seven days of waiting, the walls of their city, Aphek, fall and God’s people are victorious (1 Kings 20:29-30). Roles reversed, Ben-Hadad surrenders to Ahab (1 Kings 20:32). But foolishly, Ahab doesn’t act like Joshua. He doesn’t kill the enemy of God’s people but instead releases Ben-Hadad for new trading routes in Syria (1 Kings 20:34). Ahab should have known that when God provides Joshua-like victory, it comes with Joshua-like expectations.

So, a new prophet rises up and condemns Ahab’s disobedience and predicts his death (1 Kings 20:42). Instead of repenting, Ahab returns home angry and sulking (1 Kings 20:43). Ahab is still at war with God, and he has not learned who the Lord is.

Where is the Gospel?

Ahab is described as the worst king in Israel’s history (1 Kings 21:25). He not only introduces, encourages, and normalizes Baal worship, he also takes advantage of God’s kindness. 

We expect someone as evil as Ahab to meet God’s fiery punishment, like the kind we saw on Mt. Carmel. But we don’t expect God to mercifully give wicked Ahab victory in battle. And we expect even less that Ahab would be blind to these demonstrations of both God’s power and grace. At war, Ahab only sees God as an obstacle to his ambitions.

In that way, we’re all like Ahab. But instead of prophets like Elijah or undeserved victories against Syrians, we have the prophet Jesus to show us who the Lord is (Hebrews 1:2). In a demonstration of grace, Jesus goes to battle against enemies he was under no obligation to fight—our pride and our mortality (2 Timothy 1:10). Even though death and sin were our crosses to bear, he dies in battle against them. More unexpected than mercy towards a wicked king and more shocking than fire falling from heaven, Jesus dies instead of his enemies so that his enemies will know that he is the Lord (Romans 5:10). 

And in a final demonstration of God’s power, Jesus rises from the dead and rules as a gracious King forever (1 Corinthians 15:55). Jesus’ death and resurrection aren’t just proof for unbelieving hearts that he is the Lord, but also a prophetic drama (Romans 6:4). Jesus' death and resurrection do not prophesy condemnation and death, but predict eternal life for anyone who recognizes God’s true power and repents of their pride.

We’re not doomed like Ahab. We don’t have to be at war with God. In Jesus we know who God is, and he has made peace by the blood of his cross (Colossians 1:20).

Nehemiah’s tenure in Jerusalem is temporarily over. With the walls rebuilt and new leadership in place, the Persian king calls Nehemiah home for a full report. But before he leaves, Nehemiah once again pushes to populate the city with fellow Israelites. By a roll of the dice, a tenth of the Israelites living in the surrounding territories volunteer to live in Jerusalem (Nehemiah 11:1-2). And for God’s people to live in God’s city and worship properly, they need priests to work God’s temple. Before he leaves Nehemiah is careful to name the returning families who are qualified to do so (Nehemiah 11:20-21). 

The wall is formally dedicated and, more importantly, the establishment of God’s city is celebrated (Nehemiah 12:27). Instead of just a tenth, every temple singer that can be found is called into the city to participate (Nehemiah 12:28). Tons of instruments and hundreds of voices parade from the wall to the temple where worship of God is finally restored (Nehemiah 12:43). Once again, the law is read and Israel repents (Nehemiah 13:1). Nehemiah celebrates that Israel has broken her idolatrous unions with foreign nations, reestablishing the practice of the Sabbath and finally consecrating the temple. God’s people are back in God’s city with God’s priest in God’s temple (Nehemiah 11:18). Nehemiah leaves the city in the hands of his newly appointed governor and priest as he returns to Persia and reports to the king (Nehemiah 13:6).

But several years later, Nehemiah returns and finds his people are breaking all the commands they just swore to keep. They had rejoined their idolatrous unions with foreign nations, broken the Sabbath, and profaned the temple. Nehemiah immediately breaks their foriegn alliances, kicks out the Sabbath breakers, and restores the operation of the temple.

Three times Nehemiah intercedes for his people, asking God to remember his good deeds and not their evil (Nehemiah 13:14). In fact, those are the last words of the book: “Remember me with favor, my God” (Nehemiah 13:31). Nehemiah hopes he can be a stand-in for Israel and avoid another act of God that would destroy the walls he just built, sending his people into exile once again. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Israel never recovered from her idolatry and exile. The nation and land would pass from empire to empire until the time of Jesus. But Jesus does what Nehemiah wanted to do, but couldn’t. On the cross, Jesus acts as our stand-in (1 Peter 3:18). And God remembers his good deeds instead of our evil (2 Corinthians 5:21). Like a faithful priest, Jesus intercedes for us and makes a way for us to be a new people of God who can faithfully live in God’s city and Kingdom. 

That’s because when Jesus leaves his people to go back to the King, we are not fated to fall back into our patterns of sin (John 14:18). Unlike Nehemiah, Jesus leaves us with his Holy Spirit to continue the obedience he began in us (Galatians 5:16). Because of the Spirit, we are not fated to continually break the commands we have vowed to keep. 

Instead, we’re empowered by God to obey Jesus’ commands as we wait for his return. And when he does, a New Jerusalem and a new Kingdom will come too (Revelation 21:2). The home and city Israel hoped for, will finally come. Jesus won’t just bring a tenth of his people, but all his people inside his walls. And with far more joy than all Israel’s singers could muster, we will sing with full-throated triumph as we enter into our final home with God (Revelation 19:6).  

See For Yourself 

I pray the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who has an eternal plan to bring us hope and a future. And may you see Jesus as the fullness of God’s plan who brings us the hope of an eternal home with him by dying in our place on the cross."

Zerubbabel and some returning exiles have begun to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. But they are not alone. Though sent with the permission and authority of Persia’s King Cyrus, Jerusalem’s enemies in Samaria are not ready to let go of the land they took over in Israel’s absence (Ezra 4:1). 

Samaritans are famous in the Bible for blending their pagan religious practices with the worship of Israel’s God (2 Kings 17:25). And so they offer to help build Israel’s temple. But this is not an act of charity (Ezra 4:2). It’s a way to ensure the preservation and dominance of their syncretistic religion after Israel rebuilds its place of worship. But Israel’s leaders refuse their help and maintain the purity of God’s temple (Ezra 4:3). 

Instead, the Samaritans try to stop the construction project through a series of bribes and legal accusations sent by multiple letters to Persia over the course of several years (Ezra 4:5). To prove the severity of the threat, the narrative jumps ahead to the reign of the Persian king Artaxerxes (Ezra 4:7). Under his rule, the Samaritans’ accusations will find firm footing and eventually halt the construction of the temple (Ezra 4:23). The Samaritan threat will be real and long-lasting. 

But then, the narrative jumps back in time to the Samaritans’ first attempts to undermine Zerubbabel’s work. For about 16 years they are able to force the exiles to stop building and secure the continuation of their false worship. However, under the direction of two prophets, Zerubbabel restarts the building effort (Ezra 5:2). This triggers the Samaritans to write another long letter to Persia, now ruled by king Darius (Ezra 5:6). But when Darius digs into the issue he rediscovers Cyrus’s decree that gave Zerubbabel the right to rebuild (Ezra 6:1-2). In honor of his predecessor, Darius doubles down on Israel’s protection and provision (Ezra 6:8).

With newfound freedom and supplies, the temple is completed and the Samaritans' false worship is overthrown by Israel’s obedience to God (Ezra 6:14). Israel celebrates with a feast and dedicates the temple by offering over 700 sacrifices (Ezra 6:16). 

Importantly, Israel’s leaders offer 12 male goats as sin offerings (Ezra 6:17). They are a symbolic admission of national guilt. Israel’s 12 tribes, like the Samaritans around them, had not been faithful to God alone. But the sacrifices also symbolized God’s willingness to forgive and keep his promises to them. With true worship restored and the temple rebuilt, even outsiders could now enter God’s presence. Anyone who willingly separates themselves from their false religions and commits themselves to God alone can join the celebration (Ezra 6:21). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus also had an encounter with a Samaritan about the temple (John 4:7). Like the Samaritans from Ezra, she claimed to worship God while practicing the blended beliefs of her ancestors (John 4:20). Jesus refused to compromise the purity of what devotion to God alone looks like (John 4:22). He said that pure devotion to God would not be based on a place, like Israel’s temple (John 4:21). Instead, true worship would be based on a person—Jesus himself. Jesus is the final location of the unblended and uncompromised presence of God. 

Like the Samaritans’ letters that were sent to multiple kings to end Israel’s temple, Jesus’ enemies shipped Jesus from ruler to ruler to secure a death sentence for him (Luke 23:7). As Israel’s enemies succeeded in halting the temple project, Jesus’ enemies succeeded in destroying Jesus’ body, the ultimate temple of God. But Jesus’ death was also our final sin offering—not just for the 12 tribes of Israel, but for all people. In Jesus our guilt is cancelled and we’re invited to celebrate!

Like the Samaritans, we have blended our religious and moral preferences with true worship of God. In addition to trusting in Jesus, we’ve added our own ideas, behaviors, and worship, revealing the impurity of our faith. But by his offering on the cross, Jesus forgives our divided heart and promises to rebuild anyone who trusts him alone into a new temple; a new place where God dwells. So celebrate! In Jesus, divided and blended people like us are forgiven and made pure. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who uses the plots of his enemies to save even those who oppose him. And that you will see Jesus as the final sin offering for the world."

The story of Ezra recasts the story of Israel’s exodus from Egypt for a new generation. This generation is oppressed not by Egypt, but by Babylon. The Babylonian army has conquered her land, destroyed her temple, and driven Israel into exile. Prophets like Jeremiah promised that after 70 years, God would bring his people back into the land to rebuild the temple (Jeremiah 25:12). And in Ezra, that time has come (Ezra 1:1). It’s time for a new exodus. 

Babylon has recently been conquered by Persia, under the command of King Cyrus. And God moves on this king’s heart to send some Israelites back to their home and land. And like Israel plundered Egypt of their wealth, this king sends them with all the resources they need to rebuild God’s temple (Exodus 12:36; Ezra 1:6). In Exodus, God hardens Pharaoh's heart to prevent Israel from going to worship him. But in Ezra, God softens Cyrus’s heart to allow Israel to rebuild their temple. God is performing another miraculous rescue. God has not abandoned his people during their exile. God is being faithful not only to Jeremiah’s promise, but to a much older promise as well. 

In Genesis, God promised Abraham that his descendants would live in their land and would be a blessing to all nations (Genesis 12:2). Rebuilding Israel’s temple begins the fulfillment of God’s promise to bless all nations through Abraham’s descendants (Ezra 1:2). Isaiah, another of Israel’s prophets, also said God’s house would be rebuilt and all nations would come to it (Isaiah 2:2). With Israel heading back into their land, God’s ancient promises are coming true.

Where is the Gospel?

God’s promises are not ultimately fulfilled in the pages of Ezra, but in the life of Jesus. Jesus invites us into a new and better Exodus story; a story that proves no matter how far from God and his home we may be, he provides a way back. 

Like Ezra repeated the story of Exodus for a new generation, so does Jesus. At Jesus’ birth, Herod, like Pharoah, executes infanticide (Matthew 2:16). Like the Jews, Jesus is called out of his exile in Egypt to return home (Matthew 2:14-15). At his baptism, Jesus even passes through the Jordan River like Israel did when they first entered their promised land (Matthew 3:13). God has not abandoned his people. He will bring us back from any dark and oppressive corner of the earth to live freely at home with him forever. 

But this final homecoming cannot happen until an exodus is made from death. Like God moved on the kings in Exodus and Ezra, God moves on governor Pilate to sentence Jesus to death (John 19:11). But as God saved Israel from Egypt in Exodus and brought them out of Babylon in Ezra, God raised Jesus from the dead and brought him out of the grave in Jerusalem. This is our final exodus. This is the ultimate proof that God is faithful to his promises. Since God did not abandon Jesus to the grave, he will not abandon anyone who puts faith in him (2 Corinthians 4:14).  

This is how God fulfills his promises to Abraham. Jesus is the descendant of Abraham who will bless and include all nations (Acts 26:23). No one, regardless of their geography, nationality, or history, is outside the reach of the final exodus from exile that Jesus provides.  

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is faithful to his promises. And may you see Jesus as the one who proved God’s faithfulness by performing the final exodus for all of us when he rose from the dead."

The walls surrounding Jerusalem have been smashed to rubble and its gates burned to ash. Any hope of protection and peace in Jerusalem has crumbled with the wall. But with letters of authority from Persia’s king, an armed escort, and resources to rebuild the wall, Nehemiah approaches Jerusalem (Nehemiah 2:9).

But Nehemiah’s efforts are immediately opposed. Two enemies, Sanballat and Tobiah, are furious that he has come to help the people of Israel (Nehemiah 2:10). Like the enemies Israel first drove out under Joshua, these new enemies have settled in the land God promised his people and are unwilling to leave. 

Conscious of this, Nehemiah goes on a secret three-day reconnaissance mission to the devastated city of Jerusalem (Nehemiah 2:11). It’s the same tactic Joshua used in Jericho (Joshua 2:22). Nehemiah is a new Joshua, retaking the promised land from God’s enemies. Only, instead of defeating his enemies by tearing their walls down, he is winning victory by building Israel’s walls up. Like Joshua, Nehemiah rallies his troops by telling them to rise up because God will give them success (Joshua 6:16). And despite the opposition, the whole nation sets out to rebuild the wall and its gates (Nehemiah 3:1). 

Sanballat and Tobiah are enraged (Nehemiah 4:1). They conspire with the Arabs and the Ashdodites to stop Nehemiah (Nehemiah 4:7). The four nations’ armies surround Jerusalem on their north, south, east, and west and plot a surprise attack on the builders of the wall (Nehemiah 4:11). 

But as Nehemiah prays, God reveals the enemy’s plot to Nehemiah (Nehemiah 4:15). Before they can attack, Nehemiah arms each worker with a weapon and establishes shifts so that while one man guards the wall, the other builds it (Nehemiah 4:18, 22). With the element of surprise gone, God’s people thwart the plans of their enemies and slowly rebuild the wall. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Israel’s prophets promised that after Jerusalem’s walls were ruined, God would build them back up (Isaiah 44:26). The prophet Zechariah pictured a day when God would surround his city like a wall of fire. He would live in all his glory with his people (Zechariah 2:5). Rebuilding the walls didn’t just keep Israel safe from their enemies, the walls secured their proximity to God. 

We should all want a city with walls like that—a city that keeps us completely safe and close to God’s power and presence. That city has been secured by Jesus. Jesus has thwarted the plans of the enemy. And like Nehemiah, he has armed his people to the teeth (Ephesians 6:10-11). God’s city is now being built in and through us (1 Peter 2:4-5)! And one day soon Jesus will come in fire and live with his people in all his glory.

Jesus’ final city won’t be cobbled together out of burnt rubble, but built from precious stones and metals (Revelation 21:18). The gates will be cut out of boulder-sized pearls and emeralds (Revelation 21:21). The symbolic point is that Jesus will spare no expense in the provision and protection of his people. And the best news of all is that the gates along this heavenly wall will never be shut (Revelation 21:25). In God’s coming Kingdom there will be no enemies, no threats, no danger, and no schemes that will take us away from our eternal proximity and home with Jesus.

See For Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who walls his people off from danger. And may you see Jesus as the builder of our final city where we will dwell in safety with him forever."

There hasn’t been a king in Jerusalem for over a hundred years. But Nehemiah will act like the king Israel needs. While some Jews have returned from exile, their lack of a God-fearing king has led to corruption, injustice, and the widespread disobedience of God’s laws. And the crumbled state of Jerusalem’s walls are a symbol of Israel’s decayed leadership and moral authority. Nehemiah has begun to rebuild Israel’s broken walls, but he needs to rebuild Israel’s broken leadership too. 

Nehemiah learns of severe economic injustice among his people (Nehemiah 5:1). In order to afford the Persian king’s taxes and to purchase food during a drought, many poorer Jews have been forced to put up their farmland and even their children as collateral for loans (Nehemiah 5:3-5). Meanwhile, the rich in the city have been made richer by keeping the profits made off the property and labor held in security (Nehemiah 5:7).

Outraged, Nehemiah challenges the leaders to return all collateral and the profits made off the people to their original owners (Nehemiah 5:11). And surprisingly, the leaders listen and repent of their corruption. Nehemiah is appointed as governor over Judah and continues a reign of justice. He refuses to accept the perks afforded him as governor (Nehemiah 5:14). Instead, he uses his wealth to serve his officials and those coming to him for justice (Nehemiah 5:17). Nehemiah acts like the king Jerusalem needs—and under his rule the walls of Jerusalem are built, save for the gates. 

Nehemiah’s enemies are increasingly desperate (Nehemiah 6:1). Before he can build the gates, they try to lure him outside the city wall, presumably for a truce. But Nehemiah sees through the trap (Nehemiah 6:2). So instead they send propaganda into the city, claiming Nehemiah is trying to take Jerusalem’s throne and rebel against the king of Persia (Nehemiah 6:6). This lie carries a hint of truth. Nehemiah has assumed more and more control of Israel, and Israel does need a new king. But Nehemiah is clear—kingship is not his intention and he successfully stops the enemies' lies (Nehemiah 6:8). And by God’s help, the gates are installed and the walls are rebuilt in an impossible 52 days (Nehemiah 6:15). 

The city, however, is empty. None of the houses inside the city have been rebuilt and most of Israel remains in exile (Nehemiah 7:4). So Nehemiah calls his people back to the city and recounts the names of those who rebuilt the temple in Ezra chapter 2 (Nehemiah 7:5). In faith, those exiles returned to their homeland to rebuild God’s temple. With the walls built, Nehemiah challenges a new generation to come home and be God’s people once again. 

Where is the Gospel?

Nehemiah acted as king. Even his enemies pointed out that Nehemiah’s leadership seemed to be fulfilling the words of Israel’s prophets (Nehemiah 6:7). And rebuilding Jerusalem was supposed to set the stage for Israel’s true king to return (Jeremiah 33:15). But Nehemiah was not Israel’s king. In fact, Israel would not have her own king again until Jesus. 

In Jesus’ day, like Nehemiah’s, injustice and oppression grew unchecked in Israel. Jerusalem’s enemies overtook their land and even installed their own kings (Luke 1:5). And many of the Jewish people were still in exile. But like Nehemiah, Jesus came to Jerusalem to be the leader they needed. 

He cared for the poor and rebuked their oppressors. Like Nehemiah, he refused the riches he deserved and instead provided for those in need (Philippians 2:6-7). But unlike Nehemiah, he provided justice not by staying in the city walls when his enemy tried to trap him, but by going outside the walls into his enemy’s hands (Hebrews 13:12). Nehemiah’s enemies called him a king in hopes that it might lead to his death, but Jesus’ enemies mockingly called him a king at his death (Luke 23:38). But unlike Nehemiah, this title for Jesus couldn’t have been more accurate. Jesus is the King of whom the prophets spoke. He is the leader who brings justice, safety from enemies, and builds us a home. 

Ultimately, Jesus will do this when he returns. In his final city, King Jesus will blot out evil and oppression forever (Revelation 21:4). He will keep us safe and secure from all harm (Revelation 22:3). And as King of the whole earth, Jesus will bring all nations to himself as one people (Revelation 22:2). Jesus is the King we need.

I pray the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who always provides the leader his people need. And may you see Jesus as our final King who brings justice, safety, and a home to all people."

God moves on the heart of Israel’s new Persian overlord. He sends a delegation of exiles to return to their temple and obey everything their law requires (Ezra 7:6). He wants Israel to worship their God once again. But Persia’s king is only hedging his bets. He wants to make sure the wrath of Israel’s God doesn’t come against him and his kingdom (Ezra 7:23). But while the Persian king is being politically expedient, God is providing and planning a way to turn his people back to him. 

So the king sends Ezra—an expert in Israel’s law—to teach Israel how to follow their God after a long time in exile (Ezra 7:6a). And God follows Ezra. Anything he needs to teach obedience and turn back God’s wrath is given to him (Ezra 8:22). In fact every time there is a problem God provides. When Ezra arrives in Israel he realizes there are no qualified priests who can work in the temple (Ezra 8:15). But God provides a priest (Ezra 8:18) And Jerusalem obediently offers sacrifices according to the law Ezra taught them (Ezra 8:35). 

God’s plan is working. But then Ezra learns that the Israelites had unlawfully intermarried with the idolatrous inhabitants of their land (Ezra 9:2). In Israel’s history, marriages like these and disobedience have gone hand in hand. Idolatrous marriages like these were part of the reason Israel was exiled in the first place. And they threatened a new wave of God’s wrath (Ezra 9:14).

So Ezra laments over his nation’s sins (Ezra 9:6). But seeing Ezra weep and lament on their behalf, a large crowd of Israelites gather around him (Ezra 10:1). They admit their sin and know what must be done (Ezra 10:2). Those who have intermarried must separate from their unlawful spouses and give fidelity and obedience to God alone (Ezra 10:3). Repentance and revival break out. Israel leaves her sinful marriages and recommits herself to God (Ezra 10:17). God’s plan is working!

Where is the Gospel?

God’s laws are like marriage vows, and to Israel God is like a husband, angry at his chronically cheating bride. Israel’s idolatrous marriages are a rejection of the vows they made to God. God is angry, and if Israel wants her relationship with God to be restored and God’s presence returned to his temple, the people must cut off their idolatrous marriages and remember their vows (Ezra 10:14). A marriage means nothing if there isn’t fidelity to one spouse to the exclusion of others. Likewise the presence of a temple, a priest, and sacrifices means nothing if the people have joined themselves to other lovers and other gods. God’s presence demands obedience.

While human marriages might end in divorce, our unfaithfulness to God ends in death and exile (Romans 6:23). But as Ezra pointed out, God did not treat Israel as their sins deserved (Ezra 9:13). With full knowledge of their infidelity, God showed them faithful love. God brought them back to their rightful home, gave them a teacher to remind them of their vows, and promised to fill his temple with his presence despite their checkered history (Ezra 9:8). 

And what God began with Ezra he finished with Jesus. The presence Israel hoped would fill the temple, became flesh and lived among us (John 1:14). Like both Ezra and the Persian king expected, Jesus did not come to bring the anger our sins deserve (John 3:17). But in full knowledge of our entrenched unfaithfulness, Jesus died to save his bride and end his wrath (Romans 5:9). 

In turn, Jesus’ faithfulness to his people makes us into the faithful bride Israel never was (Ephesians 5:25-27). We are now filled with his loving presence. We are new, spotless temples. And by his powerful, loving, husbandly word we exclude all other spouses, remain faithful to our vows, and are blameless and pure before our God. 

See For Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God whose wrath stands against all unfaithfulness. And that you will see Jesus as the one who lovingly fell under the wrath we deserve to make us into his faithful bride."

For decades, the Israelites have been exiled from their home. Though Ezra began to rebuild Israel’s temple, God’s people are not safe. Jerusalem’s city walls have been broken down and destroyed by fire (Nehemiah 1:3). 

When Nehemiah, a high-ranking Jewish official to the king of Persia, hears about the walls and the state of his people, he weeps, fasts, and prays (Nehemiah 1:4). He prays from the book of Deuteronomy. Nehemiah laments that he and his people have broken God’s law (Nehemiah 1:7). He mourns that their current exile is the consequence of their sin (Nehemiah 1:8). 

In other words, the law has been fulfilled in their exile. But God also promised that if his people kept the law’s commands and returned to him, he would bring them back home (Nehemiah 1:9). Nehemiah wonders if he can fulfill this promise on his own and as Israel’s representative. Perhaps Nehemiah’s obedience and intercession can end Israel’s exile. 

After about four months of fasting and praying, Nehemiah reveals his sadness for his people to the Persian king (Nehemiah 2:1-2). It’s a calculated risk. Nehemiah wants to save his people, and he knows the king can help. But Nehemiah’s livelihood is on the line if the king responds poorly.

When the king asks what’s wrong, Nehemiah asks to leave the king and return to Israel with the promise of royal protection (Nehemiah 2:7). Nehemiah also wants the money and resources necessary to renovate the wall (Nehemiah 2:8a). And astonishingly, the king agrees. God’s hand is on Nehemiah and turns the king’s heart on his behalf (Nehemiah 2:8b). God responds to Nehemiah’s prayerful obedience and begins to bring his people home. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Since creation, it has always been God’s plan to have a home where he can live with us (Exodus 29:45). That’s what the garden of Eden was—a home for God and his people. But just as it happened in the garden, God’s people disobey and are separated from their home with God (Genesis 3:24). Exile isn’t just a political term, it's a spiritual reality. 

But God has made gracious promises to bring his people out of exile and back to himself. He even promises to transform the ruins of Israel back into a new garden of Eden (Ezekiel 36:35). But these promises can only come true when someone like Nehemiah is willing to intercede and obey on behalf of people who won’t and can’t. That leader is Jesus. Jesus is the leader who can fulfill all of God’s promises (2 Corinthians 1:20). 

As Nehemiah interceded for the exiles, Jesus intercedes for us (Romans 8:34). As Nehemiah obeyed on behalf of his people, Jesus fulfills the law for us (Matthew 5:17). Like Nehemiah, Jesus sacrificed his high position to save his needy people (Philippians 2:6-7). And just as God’s hand rested on the king of Persia to provide protection and provision for Nehemiah and God’s people, God’s hand rested on the authorities of Jesus’ day. God protected and provided a home for his people, not with money, but at the cost of his own Son (Acts 2:23).

Willingly, Jesus gave up his authority to give us a home. Sacrificially, Jesus gave up his life to free us from our exile. Perfectly, he obeyed to death so that by faith we can live as righteous natives in a new garden of Eden (Romans 4:24). Jesus is the leader our exiled hearts need. Trust him and soon you will be home.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God whose grace is greater than our sin. And that you will see Jesus as the one who enters our exile to bring us home."

He did not use his power to abuse or kill, but to heal and raise the dead.",Website,1 & 2 Samuel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

A battle with the Ammonites simmers in the background of one of the Bible’s most infamous stories: David’s abuse of Bathsheba and the murder of her husband. Placing David’s most shameful moment among stories of bravery heightens the dishonor and cowardice of David’s actions. 

A year into the conflict with the Ammonites, David sends Joab, his general, to finish the job without him. Rather than going with his men to actively protect his kingdom, David passively stays put and abuses his position (2 Samuel 11:1). In his leisure, he lusts after the wife of a decorated soldier Uriah, takes her into his palace, sleeps with her, and gets her pregnant (2 Samuel 11:4-5). Hoping to hide the scandal, he brings Uriah home from battle early and tries to manipulate him into sleeping with his wife (2 Samuel 11:8). It’s early enough in the pregnancy that Uriah will never know the child isn’t his. 

But Uriah refuses. It would be wrong to enjoy his own home and wife while his men are at war (2 Samuel 11:11). Even when David gets Uriah intoxicated, a drunk Uriah is more honorable than a sober David (2 Samuel 11:13). So David decides to kill Uriah (2 Samuel 11:15). With Joab’s help they jeopardize the campaign against the Ammonites to kill one of their own. Callously, David believes his men’s lives are necessary costs to protect his reputation (2 Samuel 11:25). With Uriah dead, David adds Bathsheba to his harem and hides the scandal (2 Samuel 11:27). But not from God.

God sends his prophet Nathan to confront David (2 Samuel 12:1). But first, Nathan lets David condemn himself (2 Samuel 12:5). Nathan tells a story that provokes David to demand the death penalty (2 Samuel 12:3, 6). But when Nathan points out that David is the man he’s sentencing, David repents and God forgives him (2 Samuel 12:7, 13). But the rest of David’s reign will be poisoned by these events. David and Bathsheba’s son will die and David’s leadership will continue to be marked by passivity and abuse (2 Samuel 12:14). 

That’s why the story ends when David once again sends Joab to fight the Ammonites, without him (2 Samuel 12:26-27). Like before, David stays at home and is only roused from his passivity to take something that’s not his. David takes credit for Joab’s victory, and crowns himself with another king’s gold (2 Samuel 12:28, 30). 

Where is the Gospel?

Ultimately, power belongs to the Lord and David is most powerful when he submits to God. But David has now disregarded God’s authority. In the book of Deuteronomy God commands Israel’s kings not to take multiple wives or collect much gold (Deuteronomy 17:17), not to mention conspire against and murder their citizens (Deuteronomy 5:17). David has forgotten who’s in charge. He’s elevated his own reputation above God’s decrees and is taking advantage of his citizens to satisfy his lusts. David misused the power God gave him and he’s humbled for it. 

The book of Samuel warns us that the people who misuse the power God gives them will be exposed for the weak, abusive people they are. If you believe it’s acceptable to reject God’s commands, especially if you’re in a position of authority, you will be humbled by the God who does not tolerate abuse. There will be a reckoning for anyone who mistreats those they’re supposed to protect. 

While David does repent, and in many ways is Israel’s best king, Jesus is a better King than David. Jesus never forgot who was in charge (John 5:19). He knew his authority was a delegated one (Matthew 28:18). He did not use his power to abuse or kill, but to heal and raise the dead (Luke 8:53-54). He did not elevate his own reputation above God’s decrees, but was humiliated on the cross (Philippians 2:8). Jesus leveraged his power for our forgiveness, not his own self-protection. And Jesus promises that he will use his kingly authority to serve us forever (Luke 12:37). 

Like David, you can choose to disregard Jesus’ power to your own humiliation. Or like Jesus, you can humble yourself before the King of the Universe and be exalted. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who opposes the proud. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives grace to the humble."

Saul is king, but in name only. God’s Spirit has left him and filled David instead (1 Samuel 18:12). 

And everybody in Israel and Saul’s family sees this clearly. Jonathan, Saul’s son and crown prince, loves David (1 Samuel 18:3). He even gives him his royal clothes and weapons as a sign of loyalty to David’s dynasty above his father’s (1 Samuel 18:5). Michal, Saul’s daughter, wants to marry David (1 Samuel 18:28). The women of Israel write songs about how David is ten times greater than Saul (1 Samuel 18:7). And the fighting men of Israel love following him into battle against the Philistines (1 Samuel 18:16, 30). While Saul’s nation and family celebrate David, Saul is jealous and afraid (1 Samuel 18:12).

Tormented by an evil spirit, Saul tries to impale David with a spear three times (1 Samuel 18:11; 1 Samuel 19:10) and then conspires to kill him secretly (1 Samuel 19:1). But Michal, hearing of the plot, lies to her father so she can protect her now husband David (1 Samuel 19:12-13). Saul’s whole family is now more loyal to God’s anointed than to their own father’s kingdom. 

David escapes to Ramah where the prophet Samuel lives (1 Samuel 15:34). When Saul and his assassins try to hunt him down, they meet Samuel first and are immediately overwhelmed by God’s Spirit. They strip themselves naked, are unable to move, and can’t stop prophesying until David escapes again (1 Samuel 19:24). Previously, prophecy was a sign of God’s anointing. It was one of the miracles that validated Saul’s kingship (1 Samuel 10:6). But now it’s a sign of God’s judgment against Saul and the choice of David as his replacement. 

David then returns to Jonathan, hoping to understand why Saul is hunting him (1 Samuel 20:1). Jonathan’s convinced there’s been a misunderstanding between David and his father (1 Samuel 20:2). But when Jonathan learns the truth, like Michal, he lies to his father (1 Samuel 20:28) and secures a way for David to escape (1 Samuel 20:22). 

Even though David is God’s anointed—and everybody in Saul’s family and kingdom recognizes God’s power in him—Saul refuses to humble himself and determines to hunt David down.

Where is the Gospel?

The author of Samuel wants us to see for ourselves what Jonathan, Michal, David, and Israel all saw so clearly—God is with David and has abandoned Saul (1 Samuel 18:12). Saul’s spiritual and emotional torment is proof God is against him. David’s victories against the Philistines, his escapes from Saul’s assassination attempts, and his acceptance by Israel prove God is with him.  He is the chosen king of Israel.

Saul’s conspiracies against David mirror the political and religious establishment’s conspiracies against Jesus. Herod tries to kill Jesus soon after he’s born, but he’s outwitted by those he thought he could trust (Matthew 2:16). As Jesus’ ministry grows he’s celebrated by all of Israel, and even greeted like a king when he enters Jerusalem (Matthew 21:9). Jealous like Saul, the Pharisees plot murder (Matthew 27:18). They recruit Judas to their assassination plot and he’s tormented by an evil spirit (Luke 22:3). Even Pilate’s wife is haunted by bad dreams before her husband hands Jesus over to the Pharisees (Matthew 27:19). Everyone in Israel seems to see Jesus as God’s chosen King—except those too blinded by their pride and thirst for power. 

But while David escapes Saul’s conspiracies, Jesus doesn’t. The Pharisees and the politicians murder Jesus (Matthew 27:50). But death was simply preparation for God’s greatest victory. Jesus’ resurrection is God’s greatest proof that Jesus is his chosen King. (Mark 16:6). 

So now, like Michal and Jonathan, we confront the conspiracies of darkness with counterplots for resurrection life. The gospel is good news to the humble, and doom to the proud. No matter how strong the corrupt powers might be, they are no match for a resurrected King. So, like Michal and Jonathan, pledge loyalty to God’s chosen King and Kingdom. You can be sure the proud will fall. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is with his anointed ones. And may you see Jesus as God’s chosen King who shames our enemies’ plans and raises us up to thrones with him."

Israel has rejected God as her King. One by one Israel’s leaders reject God’s rule and replace it with lust, idolatry, and brutal ambition. But now, in the final chapters, we see how the people of Israel are no different than their leaders. 

A man named Micah crafts an idol, builds a shrine, and strangely dedicates it to Yahweh (Judges 17:3). Micah then tries to legitimize his shrine and manipulate God into blessing him by paying someone from the tribe of Levi to perform his cultic rituals (Judges 17:13). 

Micah knows enough of God’s law to know that Levites are God’s chosen priests, but he doesn’t care that he has broken God’s first commandment to not make idols. Micah and his priest are evidence that Israel has rejected God as her King and now trust themselves more than God (Judges 17:6). 

But strangely, the sacrifices Micah makes at his false altar work. The tribe of Dan is looking for a new homeland. The Danite leaders worship at Micah’s shrine, hoping for direction—and they get it (Judges 18:5-6). They send spies into the land of Laish and determine it’s ripe for the taking (Judges 18:10). 

Dan quickly musters its troops and even steals Micah’s false idol and mercenary priest (Judges 18:18). Seemingly securing God’s presence, they confidently overthrow Laish (Judges 18:27). Moses’ grandson is then anointed as a priest over the Danites (Judges 18:30). 

On the surface, the Danites have everything God promised them. They have a homeland, a temple with their god’s presence, and a descendent of Israel’s founding father, Moses, as one of their leaders. But the question becomes—at what cost? 

This tribe of Israel has gained the world, but lost their soul. 

Where is the Gospel?

Unwilling to stand bravely against the religious, cultural, and, ethical preferences of Canaan, Israel adopts the beliefs wholesale. Israel’s priests are mercenaries, her leaders are opportunistic, and the people are thieves and idolaters. 

This story forces us to ask the question: Are we willing to lose our soul, if it means we gain a kingdom? Is political power worth sacrificing true worship of God?

If we’re honest, it’s hard to tell if we’re all that different from Israel. We’re either unwilling to stand against the cultural preferences of our day and so we accept them uncritically, or we are unwilling to consider the loss of political power and would rather adopt violence wholesale.

We all want to build a kingdom that’s right in our own eyes. We’re trying to build a kingdom without its proper King. Jesus himself warns that if we are unwilling to die to either political power or cultural acceptance, we might win for a while, but we will lose our souls (Matthew 16:25-26). Instead, Jesus invites us to die a different type of death—a death to the power plays of the tribe of Dan and the cultural idolatry of Micah. If we are willing to deny those impulses and pick up our cross as Jesus did and die to all agendas except God’s, not only will we save our souls, we will gain the whole world (Matthew 16:24). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is King. And may you see Jesus as the King who picked up his cross so that all those who follow will keep their souls and gain the world."

The book of Judges has two introductions. In the first, Joshua’s death is followed by a series of military conquests and defeats (Judges 1:19). The defeats signal that not everything is as it should be in Israel. When Joshua ruled, Israel was undefeated. God fought by their side in every battle (Joshua 1:13). Their obedience and faith meant every enemy fell before Joshua’s sword (Joshua 23:9). 

The fact that every tribal leader after Joshua experiences military defeat signals that the faith and obedience that marked Joshua’s leadership has dissolved (Judges 1:27). Israel disobediently enslaves the Canaanites rather than drive them out (Judges 1:28). And soon Israel will join Canaan in her child sacrifice and sexual exploitation. So an angel of the Lord who first showed up to Joshua, now tells Joshua’s successors to expect judgment (Judges 2:1).

When the angel spoke to Joshua, he warned him that he wasn’t fighting on Israel’s side of the battle, but on God’s (Joshua 5:14). The angel reappears in Judges because he is no longer fighting for Israel, but against her (Judges 2:3). 

In the second introduction we are shown a pattern that will repeat throughout the rest of the book. God’s chosen leader will die (Judges 2:8). Israel will then abandon God, join in the Canaanites’ immorality, and experience God’s anger in the form of an invasion (Judges 2:11, 14). But the Lord will appoint another leader to rescue Israel from her enemy and reinstitute God’s laws (Judges 2:18). This pattern also becomes a downward spiral (Judges 2:19). Israel’s evil will intensify with each generation. But strangely, so will God’s mercy. 

Where is the Gospel?

We’re told that Israel’s pattern of death followed by disobedience followed by God’s anger followed by God’s mercy is meant to test Israel (Judges 2:22). Again and again, God offers Israel the opportunity to listen and obey him rather than chase after the gods of the Canaanites. 

But in Judges, Israel never passes this test and never breaks the cycle. While a good leader might lead Israel to faithfulness for a while, that leader’s death would also plunge Israel further down the spiral. 

And we know what that’s like. Our lives and our churches experience decay, death, corruption, and scandal. Sadly, many pastors and leaders do not pass the test. More often than we care to admit, their legacies reveal deeper scandal and division than we thought possible. And every Christian leader who falls proves we are still stuck in the same pattern the book of Judges describes. 

But Jesus is the Judge who breaks the cycle. He is the only leader who can rescue us from judgment, reinstitute God’s laws, and guarantee God’s mercy. 

That’s because Jesus passes the test that Israel’s leaders couldn’t—and we can’t. He listened to and obeyed God, not just in his life but in his death (Philippians 2:8). He didn’t succumb to the forces of decay, corruption, and scandal, so God raised him from the dead (Acts 13:24). Jesus now lives forever. He’s the eternal leader whose legacy is peace, obedience, and justice—not violence, corruption, and abuse. 

Like the angel who said his allegiance was neither with Canaan or Israel, Jesus said his Kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36). It cannot be won through violence and political power, but by God’s sacrificial love. The book of Judges makes us hope for a leader, and Jesus is that leader! By faith we have citizenship in a Kingdom Israel never fully entered. 

Under Jesus’ rule God’s peace is guaranteed. By Jesus’ judgments he condemns evil and vindicates the abused. By Jesus’ Spirit he breaks the cycle so that his people can rule with him forever. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who tests his people. And may you see Jesus as our Judge who passes God’s test and brings his Kingdom to all people who trust and love him."

After Gideon dies, his 70 sons are given control of Israel. One of Gideon’s sons, Abimelek, conspires with his mother and her relatives to overthrow his father. Eventually he begins his reign by slaughtering 69 of his father’s sons on a stone (Judges 9:5-6). 

But Jotham escapes Abimelek’s purge and uses a fable to warn those who are now following Abimelek (Judges 9:7). Jotham warns that honorable men are slow to accept leadership (Judges 9:11). Abimelek's meteoric rise, Israel’s uncritical allegiance to him, and Abimelek’s thirst for power will one day destroy them (Judges 9:20). 

This is exactly what happens. Abimelek is slowly handed over to the same violence he inflicted on his brothers (Judges 9:24). God is done showing mercy to Israel, and instead promises fairness and perfectly proportionate retribution (Judges 9:56-57). Throughout Abimelek’s story God is ominously silent except to further confirm Israel’s chosen path of self-destruction.

This does not mean God is absent in Abimelek’s increasingly grisly victories (Judges 9:49). Rather, God directs Abimelek’s bloodlust to its deserved end. 

Just as Abimelek's conspiracy depended on the support of his mother’s family and the slaughtering of his brothers on a stone, Abimelek is killed by a mother with a stone. Abimelek receives perfectly proportional retribution for his crimes in the form of a woman crushing his skull with a rock (Judges 9:53). 

Where is the Gospel?

Paul, in his letter to the Romans, tells us that God’s judgment is seen when he hands us over to our sinful desires (Romans 1:24). Like Abimelek, once we devote ourselves to the gods of this world we should not expect mercy but slow and brutal fairness. The way we dishonor God and harm others returns to us in perfect proportionality (Romans 2:6).

This is good news for those of us who have experienced despicable evil. Our tormentors will be poetically repaid for the harm they have done to us.

But ominously, we are all still under Jotham’s warning (Romans 3:23). Just as the citizens of Israel rejected Gideon’s sons, we reject God’s leadership. We pledge uncritical allegiance to greed, pride, power, and sex. Like Abimelek trusted violence, we trust our desires will secure us with the power, safety, and happiness we seek. Like Jotham warned, we should not be surprised if those things curve back round and punish us with brutal proportionality. 

But God’s fairness is not his final word to us. God is rich in mercy. He sends another Judge to his unfaithful and undeserving people—Jesus. Jesus, unlike Abimelek, is the rightful Judge of his people. But Jesus doesn’t get what he deserves; he gets what we deserve. Jesus allows our evil to curve back around on him. 

Instead of a coup, Jesus absorbs the fairness we deserve in an act of willing and humble sacrifice. He ends the retribution we’ve earned and justifies everyone who accepts his leadership (Romans 3:25-26). 

Jesus is the only leader worthy of our allegiance. He welcomes us into his Kingdom where the only thing left for us is mercy. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who repays evil proportionately and fairly. And may you see Jesus as the one who absorbs what we deserve and gives us only mercy."

This is the bottom of Israel’s spiral into depravity. They only do what’s right in their own eyes.

This becomes savagely clear in a complex narrative filled with sexual violence. It begins as a Levite looks for and finds his runaway concubine at her father’s house (Judges 19:1-2).”On the way home, the pair choose the supposedly safer Israelite city of Gibeah over the foreign city of Jebus (Judges 19:12). They are wrong. The men of the city pound on their door and demand the Levite be brought out so they can rape him (Judges 19:23). 

Unthinkably, the husband sacrifices his wife to protect himself (Judges 19:24). The men of the city rape her until morning (Judges 19:25). She dies from the trauma (Judges 19:28). The Levite carves his wife’s body into 12 pieces and ships her to the elders of the 12 tribes to incite war against Gibeah (Judges 19:29). 

Outraged, 11 of Israel’s tribes muster 400,000 troops and march on the city (Judges 20:2). But the tribe of Benjamin chooses to defend Gibeah’s immorality (Judges 20:14). For the first time since the Book of Joshua, Israel seems united in its desire to destroy the immorality in the land of Canaan (Judges 19:13). Ironically though, Israel must destroy one of her own clans to do so. The enemy of God is no longer outside, but within Israel. 

In a series of three battles both sides take heavy losses. The body count proves God’s judgment isn’t just against Benjamin, but against all of Israel’s men. Six hundred men from Benjamin escape, but no women or children are left alive (Judges 20:48). The conquering tribes then secure Benjamin’s eradication and make a law that no father can give their daughters in marriage to Benjamin (Judges 21:7).

But the men of Israel realize this is shortsighted. Israel can’t be without all 12 tribes (Judges 21:3). Their solution is a loophole. Technically no one will “give” their virgin daughters to Benjamin; instead they will “take” them by force (Judges 21:12, 23). Israel resorts to the same behavior that started the war, exploiting and raping 600 women so the men can save face. 

Where is the Gospel?

Israel has rejected God’s kingship and crowned themselves as better lawgivers (Judges 21:25). But their edicts are confused and contradictory. It’s unclear if God is for or against Israel. And the constant violence against women is grisly proof of Israel’s failures in general, but its men’s failures in particular. 

Israel needs a leader who does not do whatever seems best in his own eyes. And Israel needs a husband who will not sacrifice his bride to save his skin. That husband and that leader is Jesus. 

The Levite threw his bride to the mob and did nothing as her sexuality was abused and her body mutilated. But instead of sacrificing his bride to save himself, Jesus sacrifices himself to save his bride. Jesus was thrown to the crowds. His clothes were gambled over. He was naked. His body was stripped and abused for the pleasure of those watching. 

Jesus is the only man worthy to lead God’s people. Jesus protects his wife, unlike how the Levite and eventually all of Israel failed to do. Jesus is the only one who does what is right in God’s eyes (John 5:19). The apostle Paul tells us that when Jesus died as our husband, he did so to make us holy and clean by his Spirit (Ephesians 5:25). 

Israel’s civil war was an attempt to clean up the immorality of Gibeah, but the immorality of Gibeah was in them too. The other 11 tribes were just as capable of rape and murder. If they wanted to purge Israel of sin, they needed to kill themselves too. 

But Jesus, the true Israelite, died so that all his people could be purged from their sin. And he replaces our violent and lecherous hearts with his own Spirit. His death isn’t just sacrificial; it replaces our self-destruction with his own powerful, loving, and holy Spirit. Because of Jesus we are a new Israel. Not a kingdom of lust and violence, but one empowered by self-sacrificing love and mercy.

See For Yourself

I pray you will see the God who is King. And may you see Jesus as our loving husband who sacrifices himself to give life to his bride."

Jesus doesn't merely destroy an oppressive king, he crushes the Serpent that introduced sin and death.",Website,Judges Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

We’re introduced to the first four of Israel’s judges—Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, and Deborah. The accounts of their leadership follow the same pattern established in chapter two. Israel does evil in God’s eyes (Judges 3:7). God sends an army to discipline Israel (Judges 3:13). Israel cries out for mercy after years of oppression (Judges 4:3). Then God raises up a new judge to rescue Israel from her enemies (Judges 3:15, 30).

Israel’s first judge, Othniel, is exemplary. He is a relative of Caleb, who spied out the land of Canaan with Joshua and trusted the Lord. He’s also filled with the same Holy Spirit as Joshua (Judges 3:10). But neither his spiritual pedigree nor faithfulness is enough to secure an enduring victory for Israel. After his death, Israel becomes more evil than before.

So the next three judges act as an ironic rebuke to faithless Israel. At first this irony is almost funny. Ehud, the second judge, is a left-handed Benjaminite (Judges 3:15). Benjamin means “son of the right hand.” And this left-handed son, from the clan of the right hand, tricks and assassinates the fat enemy king Eglon. This king, whose name means “little cow,” when killed, is left undisturbed by his servants because Eglon’s time in the bathroom normally smelt that way (Judges 3:24).

Ehud’s left-handedness not only communicates a break with his tribe but symbolizes the fracturing relationship between God and his people. God has saved Israel, but the leader he chooses is the leader Israel deserves. 

That’s why Israel’s next judge, Shamgar, is the son of a woman named after a Canaanite goddess (Judges 3:31). He’s both a symbol of Israel’s idolatry and a judgment against the Canaanite religion.

It’s also why Deborah, the next judge, is a woman who prophecies that Israel’s then enemy king Sisera would be killed by another woman, Jael (Judges 4:9). Jael drives a tent peg through Sisera’s skull after lulling him to sleep with warm milk (Judges 4:17, 21). The Canaanites had a low view of women, often forcing them into cult prostitution. So Deborah and Jael are God’s judgment against Canaanite worship, but they’re also indictments of the faithlessness and cowardice of Israel’s men.

Each of these judges are judgments against both Canaan and Israel. God defeats Israel’s enemies, but he does so by giving Israel the leaders they deserve.

Where is the Gospel?

God gives us the leaders we deserve too. You don’t have to read many newspapers to see that truth. Sometimes it’s almost comedic how those in charge mirror the culture, but it’s mostly discouraging and exhausting. We don’t want the leaders we deserve anymore; we want a ruler to break the cycle and lead us, as a people, out of our faithlessness, cowardice, and division. 

And that leader is Jesus. In the Garden of Eden God promised Adam and Eve that a Judge would one day be born who would crush the head of the serpent (Genesis 3:15). One day the faithlessness, cowardice, and division of the serpent would be destroyed. When Jael smashes Sisera’s skull, it proves that God has not forgotten his plan to crush the serpent’s head (Judges 5:26). But unlike Israel’s leaders and our leaders today, the promise of this Snake-Crusher is undeserved.

Judge Jesus was promised to Adam and Eve while they were disobedient. And God says this true Ruler would sacrifice himself for his rebellious people (Genesis 3:15). When Jesus’ heels were pierced on the cross, he skewered the serpent’s head. Ironically, Jesus conquered our enemy’s rule and power through defeat and crucifixion (Colossians 2:15). Jesus is the leader we do not deserve, and he is the only Judge who can make his people faithful, brave, and unified. 

And if we trust Jesus’ judgments not only against our culture and our leaders, but also against ourselves, he will save us. He will be our leader and he will defeat our enemies.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who destroys his enemies. And may you see Jesus who descends into our sin and death in order to raise us up into His victory."

And by experiencing God's silence, Jesus now speaks a better word than the bloodshed of Jepthah - we are sons and daughters he will not forsake.",Website,Judges Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Israel is descending deeper and deeper into darkness. Jephthah’s leadership is marked by the ominous silence of God. Israel prays, but God refuses to answer (Judges 10:13). Even though Israel makes a show of shelving their idols, God refuses to raise up a new deliverer (Judges 10:16). Instead, Israel debates among themselves who will lead them (Judges 10:18). They eventually land on the son of a prostitute, Jephthah. Armed with a reputation as a warrior and a bandit (Judges 11:3, 6), Jephthah agrees to defeat the Ammonites in exchange for the right to rule over Israel (Judges 11:9).

Israel agrees and Jephthah immediately proves himself a gifted diplomat and wordsmith. Israel’s enemies, the Ammonites, claim Israel initiated an aggressive takeover of Ammonite land and want it back (Judges 11:13). But full of political savvy, Jephthah diplomatically explains Israel’s innocence (Judges 11:17-18). Cunningly, Jephthah reminds the king of Amnon that it was Israel who was attacked unprovoked and won the land in fair combat (Judges 11:20-21). Jephthah’s words prove Israel is innocent of aggression and rightfully rules the land (Judges 11:27).

But the king of the Ammonites refuses Jephthah’s diplomacy and prepares for war (Judges 11:28). As Jephthah marches toward the battle he tries to manipulate God. He gives God his word that he will offer a costly sacrifice if God gives him victory (Judges 11:30-31). But God remains silent and Jephthah’s words end up coming back to haunt him. Jephthah’s only child is killed because of his foolish “word” to the Lord (Judges 11:35). 

Jephthah’s final act as “deliverer” is to spark a civil war with Ephraim and slaughter 42,000 of them (Judges 12:6). As Jephthah dies we see another break in God’s pattern; there is no peace after Jephthah’s deliverance (Judges 12:7).

Where is the Gospel?

God is silent during Jephthah’s rule. Their sin has gone too far, their idolatry is too deep to warrant another word from God. He has left his people to the gods and leaders they’ve chosen for themselves (Judges 10:13-14). And the foolish “wordiness” of Israel’s leader is a fitting judgment for a people whose words to God have been disingenuous and manipulative. 

You might feel God’s silence too. You might have even said a prayer like Jephthah’s—something like, “God, if you will help me I’ll do whatever you want.” But you don’t have to manipulate God that way. Jesus doesn’t need hypocritical words or quickly made promises to rule in your favor (Matthew 6:7). All he needs is your trust that he is a good Judge—and an honest confession that you have done wrong (Luke 18:13-14). 

If you want to escape the silence of God, you need to trust the silence Jesus experienced. On the cross Jesus cries out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46). God’s silence toward Jesus was a sign that he has taken on the hypocrisy and manipulative words we so easily speak. So when we trust in Jesus, the silence of God ends. Instead of being trapped by what we say, we are set free from the consequences of our words by Jesus’ final words that our sin “is finished.” Jesus now speaks a better word than the bloodshed of Jephthah, we are sons and daughters whom he will not forsake or kill (Hebrews 12:23-24). God’s Word made flesh speaks into the silence our sin deserves and tells us that we are instead righteous, pure, holy, loved—and that nothing will silence God’s love toward us again (2 Corinthians 5:21). 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is silent. And may you see Jesus as the one who experiences God’s silence, so we might hear God’s voice."

God sends the Midianite army against Israel in response to her evil and disobedience (Judges 6:1). Midian is a particularly vicious overlord (Judges 6:2). Many Israelites end up living in caves, and it’s there that Israel finally cries out to God for mercy (Judges 6:6).

In response, God sends a prophet who rebukes Israel for how they’ve forgotten their deliverance from Egypt (Judges 6:9-10). Even Gideon, God’s new judge, is cynical and convinced God has abandoned them (Judges 6:13). When an angel tells him otherwise—and that he’s been appointed as Israel’s new deliverer—Gideon is reluctant and asks for proof (Judges 6:17). And when Gideon finally accepts the angel’s call, he’s fearful (Judges 6:23). When asked to tear down his father’s altar to Baal, once again fear governs his actions (Judges 6:27).

Even though the Spirit of the Lord is with Gideon, he demands additional signs to confirm God is with him (Judges 6:34, 39). After limiting Gideon’s army to 300 men—and yet mindful of Gideon’s fear—God gives him another sign the night before a miraculous victory against the Midianites (Judges 7:10). 

But once Gideon is in power, his fear gives way to brutality. Two Midianite kings escape outside the borders of Canaan and he hunts them down (Judges 8:10), violently threatening any who don’t offer support (Judges 8:7). Once he captures the kings we learn that his true motivation is revenge. These men had killed his family (Judges 8:19). 

And as final signs of Gideon’s growing brutality, he asks his young son to slaughter the enemy kings in front of him (Judges 8:20). He then demands gold as a tribute from his enemies, melts it into an idol, and worships it over his 40 years in power (Judges 8:27). Shortly after Gideon’s death, Israel officially installs Baal worship as its national religion (Judges 8:33-34). 

Where is the Gospel?

When fearful people are given power, they stop at nothing to keep it. And, significantly for our story, they forget true power comes from God. On the day Israel’s army of 300 men defeated the 135,000 Midiantes, Gideon tells his soldiers to shout “for the Lord, and for Gideon” (Judges 7:18, italics added).

Israel was given the leader they deserved. In Gideon, they saw the consequences of their own fear and disbelief. Yes, God used Gideon’s fear and violence to destroy Israel’s enemies, but that wasn’t to prove how great Gideon was. Instead, it demonstrates how great God is. God is merciful to a forgetful, fearful, and power-mongering people. God is within his rights to allow our pride and violence to slowly destroy us, but instead he uses it to save and humble us.

We see this most clearly in Jesus. God used the fear, pride, politics, and violence of Israel and Rome to hang Jesus on the cross (Acts 2:23). But unlike Gideon, Jesus wasn’t afraid of his enemies. He didn’t demand signs. He performed them for others (John 2:11)! He didn’t forget God’s power, but relied upon it regularly in prayer (Luke 5:16). Gideon cynically accused God of abandoning him, but Jesus is willingly forsaken by God.

And while Gideon’s rise to power mutated his fear into violence, Jesus’ resurrection from the dead turns the violence of the cross into a sign of victory and power. We don’t need a wet fleece to prove God’s power and presence will be with us. Jesus’ death and resurrection stand as signs forever that all those who do not forget Jesus will have nothing to fear.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is our only hero. And may you see Jesus as a sign of victory and power to all who remember him."

Samson is Israel’s final, most dramatic, and most violent judge. An angel even appears to Samson’s barren mother and announces she will birth a deliverer who will save Israel from the Philistines (Judges 13:3). Samson is also unique among the judges for his Nazarite vow. He is under oath to touch nothing unclean or dead, to neither eat grapes nor drink wine, and never cut his hair (Judges 13:5, 7). 

But Samson’s promising birth only serves to highlight his downfall. Samson sees a Philistine woman and wants to marry her even though doing so violates God’s marriage laws (Judges 14:7). We’re told Samson’s only justification is that she seems right in his eyes (Judges 14:3). This is the author’s indictment of all of Israel during this time (Judges 21:25) This phrase also foreshadows how Samson’s story will end—his eyes will be gouged out at the hands of the Philistines (Judges 16:21). 

But Samson’s lusting eyes are also the means God will use to rescue his people (Judges 14:4). We see this play out in a short story that acts as a metaphor for both the rest of Samson’s narrative and the entire Book of Judges. As Samson walks through a vineyard (which is a foolish choice since he can’t eat grapes), a lion attacks Samson and he kills it. But in doing so he breaks his Nazarite vow to not touch dead animals. He also lustily eats honey from its carcass (Judges 14:8-9). Samson’s lust for honey is a lot like his lust for Philistine women. 

His foolish marriage to the Philistine woman and his romantic trysts with Delilah all end the same way—with Philistine men pouncing on him like a lion and God granting sweet supernatural deliverance over Israel’s long-time enemies (Judges 15:14).

In strange mercy, God uses the lust and violence of Samson to rescue people bound to their own lust and violence. 

Samson’s lust eventually leaves him blind, weak, and enslaved to the Philistines. Samson uses his last breath to pray for strength to execute a final act of revenge (Judges 16:28). Like before, God empowers Samson to destroy more Philistine’s through his death than his life (Judges 16:30). Like honey from a dead lion, God brings victory through Samson’s sin.  

Where is the Gospel?

Samson is the last judge God raises up. Samson’s story serves as the climax of the book of Judges, but also as the consummate embodiment of Israel’s waywardness. He’s the final example of God using Israel’s sinfulness to accomplish his purposes (Judges 14:4).  

But Samson’s story also represents Israel’s hope. Israel is waiting for a King whose coming is announced by angels, and in whom the Spirit dwells. Israel is hoping for a leader who is strong like Samson, but whose sacrifice is greater than his might. They’re waiting for God to bring sweet peace from their lion-like enemies. 

Samson actually points us to Jesus. Jesus’ birth was announced by angels (Luke 1:30-31). And the Holy Spirit rushed on him like a dove of peace (Luke 3:22). Jesus was strong, not to avenge personal vendettas, but to remain single-minded through persecution and crucifixion. Jesus’ sacrificial death brought greater victory than his life because through his death, everyone who believes in him is saved from the stalking lions of sin and death (Romans 10:9). 

Jesus did not bring honey out of his sins, but out of ours. Jesus’ sacrificial death wasn’t to avenge but to atone. Jesus dies as the consummate embodiment of our waywardness so that we can become living examples of the way God uses sinful people to tell of and accomplish his sweet victory in all the world. Because of Jesus we taste and see that the Lord is good (Psalm 34:8). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who uses our sin to bring about our salvation. And may you taste and see that Jesus is sweeter than honey."

Deuteronomy records Moses’ last words to the people of Israel before they enter the Promised Land (1:1). 

It begins with Moses retelling the people’s journey so far. Basically, in these three chapters, we get an overview of the whole book of Numbers. 

First, Moses recounts Israel’s disobedience and destruction. God spoke to Israel at Mt. Sinai, brought them on an eleven-day journey to the border of the promised land, only to have them disobey and refuse to enter it (1:26). For this disobedience, God promises that the older generation will die in the wilderness, which they did (1:35). 

Next, Moses recounts Israel’s obedience and victory. The turning point from one to the other is the death of the old generation and the coming up of the new. Unlike the older generation, these people obeyed the voice of God and won victory over their enemies (3:3). 

The force of the argument is palpable for a people about to enter the land their parents failed to enter by driving out the people their parents failed to drive out. By recounting the story Moses is proving two points. 1. Don’t commit the mistakes of the past (4:3). 2. Remember how God has been faithful (4:9). 

How these two points go together gives us a firm grip on Deuteronomy’s main message: Remembrance leads to obedience. If Israel remembers God’s faithfulness they will love him. If they love him they will obey him. Remembering leads to loving. Loving leads to obeying (5:15).

Remembering is so crucial because it is very close to the idea of believing. To remember God’s past faithfulness is to believe in what he has done in the past. And this causes faith in what he will do in the future.  

Where is the Gospel?  

Jesus taught his disciples this same truth. This time, instead of God going before Israel into the promised land to prepare it for them, Jesus says that he is going to the house of God to prepare a place for us (John 14:2). And if they believed Jesus, then they would love him, and if they loved him they would obey his commandments (John 14:15). 

How this works and how it applies to us is repeated all throughout the New Testament letters. Again and again, the New Testament tells us to remember what Jesus did on the cross. And then, on the basis of what he’s done, we are given commands (Titus 2:11-12). The argument is identical. Jesus has rescued us and provided for us. If we remember what he has done we will be so filled with love for him that we will happily obey whatever he commands. 

Remember the Gospel, love Jesus, and obey. This is what Deuteronomy is here to teach us. 

See for Yourself 

I pray the Holy Spirit will give you eyes to see the God who shows us his past faithfulness to produce in us our present faith. And that you will see Jesus as the one who has accomplished everything fully in the past to create in us love and obedience in the present."

Moses’s speech unpacking the Ten Commandments continues with honoring your father and mother. 

But this principle extends beyond the household. Moses instructs the people about the leaders in the society as a whole they must honor and obey. 

There are four categories of leadership: judges, kings, priests, and prophets. 

In every town, the people are to appoint judges who will settle disputes among their own people. They are to be well versed in the Law. But if a matter comes up that is too difficult for them, they bring it to Yahweh in the temple (Deuteronomy 17:8). 

The people may ask for a king. But the king must be chosen by God, come from Israel, and not be given over to excessive wealth, women, or warfare (Deuteronomy 17:15). The king is to constantly study the Torah, fear God, and help Israel keep the law.

Third comes the priests from the tribe of Levi who work the tabernacle. Moses reminds the people that the Levites won’t have a land to call their own, but must be supported by the offerings of the rest of Israel (Deuteronomy 18:2). 

Finally, Moses talks about the role of the prophet. A prophet speaks the words of Yahweh that God gives them directly. If anything they say doesn’t come to pass that person is not a prophet (Deuteronomy 18:22).

These leaders are primarily there to help the people keep God’s law. 

However, the rest of the Old Testament shows judges failing, kings worshipping idols, priests forgetting the law, and prophets giving unchallenged false reports.

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus, however, succeeds in all four categories. 

Jesus is our perfect judge. He takes no bribes, shows no partiality, always maintains justice, and his decisions are always perfect (Romans 2:11). He also is the only judge who justifies by taking our penalty on himself (Romans 3:26). 

Jesus is our perfect king. He not only knew the law perfectly, he fulfilled the law perfectly (Matthew 5:17). So he does not sit on a throne enforcing the law on his people but left his throne to have the law’s penalty enforced on himself (Galatians 3:13). Then, like a good king, he leads us to follow his law as citizens of his kingdom (Matthew 28:20). 

Jesus is our perfect priest. Whereas Israel’s priests were supported by the offerings given by the people, Jesus provided his own sacrifice (Hebrews 10:12). He offered up his very self to provide once for all forgiveness for everyone who believes in him (Hebrews 10:10).

At the end of Deuteronomy, Joshua succeeds Moses and Moses performs four significant acts. He writes down the law, gives Israel a prophetic song, prays for the twelve tribes, and then dies. 

Every seven years, the law Moses wrote was to be taken out and read in the hearing of all the people (Deuteronomy 31:11). It would stand as a witness against them for all their sins and, hopefully, lead them to repent. 

God then gives Moses a prophetic song to sing. All of Israel would memorize this song and teach it to their children (Deuteronomy 32:46). They were to sing it for generations. But it is an ironic song because it predicts Israel’s own disobedience and punishment. 

The song taught Israel why they would be punished in the future. You can imagine a child singing this song after Israel was exiled from the land, and seeing realization dawn over their parents’ face. 

After the song, Moses prays a blessing over all the tribes of Israel before he dies (Deuteronomy 33:1). Despite all the evil they had done and all the evil they would do, Moses blesses them. God would not abandon them. 

Moses deputizes Joshua to lead Israel after him, and then goes up a mountain on the outskirts of the Promised Land to die (Deuteronomy 34:1). God allows him to see the land, but he is not allowed to enter it because of his disobedience at the rock in Meribah (Numbers 20:11). 

Deuteronomy closes with a striking statement. “There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The good news is that a prophet even greater than Moses has finally come, for Jesus did not just know God face to face, but is God himself. In fact, the fullness of God’s glory can be seen in the face of Jesus and his gospel (2 Corinthians 4:6). 

Unlike Moses who could not enter the land but dies, Jesus not only entered the final Promised Land of Heaven, but he earns us passage into it with him through his death.

The law Moses wrote down has survived to this day. It fulfills its role as a witness against us and our sin. But Jesus has kept the law for us. Therefore, as Moses blessed Israel in the midst of their disobedience, we receive the blessing of Christ in the midst of all our disobedience (Romans 5:8). Despite our sin, God has shown us favor. 

Isn’t it great news, then, that the ironic song that should give us the reason behind our punishment and exile, becomes a song we will never have to sing. Instead, we can sing a new song of thanks to Jesus for rescuing us from sin and death. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who has preserved the law and the scriptures as a witness against us and our sin. And that you would see Jesus as the new and better prophet like Moses, who frees us from what would have been our inevitable demise."

With the blessings and curses of the last section, the words of God’s covenant law have come to a close. Now God begs Israel to choose to obey it. 

But right away, we learn that God has not yet given Israel a heart to understand or eyes to see or ears to hear (Deuteronomy 29:4). 

This leads to a prediction Moses makes about Israel’s future. They will disobey God and be driven out of the land. The curses explained in the last section will come true (Deuteronomy 29:23). 

However, God will not leave them in exile forever. He promises that he will circumcise his people’s hearts, giving them the inner disposition they need to finally obey (Deuteronomy 30:6). They will return to the land, love God, and live with him forever (Deuteronomy 30:3). 

The law is not too hard to keep, but Israel will still break it (Deuteronomy 30:11). 

We often think the laws are impossible to follow or that they are overly rigorous. But they are actually very plain and simple commands that don’t ask very much of Israel. 

The point of the law’s simplicity isn’t that it is easy to follow. Rather, the law was given to highlight just how sinful the human heart is without God. We can’t obey the easiest commands (Romans 5:20). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Think about the command, “Don’t lie.” It’s not hard. Yet we all lie. We too are hard hearted. So what’s the solution?

Jesus earns the blessing of the law for everyone who believes in him. It is not for us to climb our way up to heaven - Jesus has come down from heaven to us (Romans 10:6). It is not for us to earn our way out of death - Jesus has already beaten the grave for us (Romans 10:7). 

We keep the law by trusting Jesus. 

And when we trust him, Jesus gives us the new heart Moses said we needed. We actually can obey the law’s commands because we walk by the Spirit of Jesus within us (Romans 8:5). 

Now it is not the law that is near us so that we can choose to obey it (Deuteronomy 30:14). Instead, the Holy Spirit is even nearer, and he causes us to obey it (Romans 8:13). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who gives us commands that are not impossible, even though we ignore them anyway. And that you would see Jesus as the one who obeys the law for us, but then gives us new hearts so we can obey it too."

Moses has already recounted Israel's travel to the border of the Promised Land. 

Now he tells the story of God speaking to the people at Mt. Sinai (4:11).

After reminding Israel of their disobedience recorded in Numbers, Moses reminds the people of God’s faithfulness recorded in Exodus. He reminds Israel that God saved them from Egypt, provided for them in the wilderness, and established a covenant with them at Mt. Sinai. 

At one point in this passage, God offers up a challenge to the people to search the length and breadth of the galaxies to find any other God that has done anything comparable to what he has done (4:32). God’s point is that he did all of this to show Israel and the world that there is no God but him and that he is capable of more than we could ever imagine. 

But Moses doesn’t just mention the fact that God showed up and spoke from Mt. Sinai. He repeats what God said. For the second time in the Torah, we come across the famous Ten Commandments (5:7). 

But why repeat them here? 

It is clear from the amount of time spent talking about it, that God is primarily concerned with Israel falling into the sin practiced by the inhabitants of the land. Above all, God is concerned with their idol worship (4:16). So he wanted to remind Israel of the firm link that exists between remembering what God has done and obeying what he has said (4:34). If Israel remembers God and his works they will obey his commands and stay away from idols. 

Where is the Gospel?  

The author of Hebrews draws heavily from these two chapters when he is pleading with Christians to persevere as well. But everything is heightened and escalated in Jesus and his Gospel. 

God didn’t just save a people by miraculously punishing their captors. He bore the punishment himself to the point of shedding his own blood (Heb. 12:3). God did not show up in a shapeless cloud of fire to bring us to a land that can be touched. He came as an actual human being to bring us to God’s actual home where there are countless heavenly hosts singing his praises (Heb. 12:18-22). 

Since his actions are so much more incredible, obedience is that much more dire. For the one who warns us is not a man named Moses living on the earth, it is the exalted man Jesus who reigns on his throne in heaven (Heb. 12:25). 

But with this more severe warning, we have a more beautiful story to remember. As we recall the story of the gospel, we are filled with so much love for him in our hearts that obeying his commands becomes our greatest joy. 

What God is there like Jesus who has done so much for us? There is none beside him. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who shows himself to be greater than anything else in the universe and thus earns our love and devotion. And that you would see Jesus as doing even greater things than the people of Israel experienced in his death, burial and resurrection."

As Moses wraps up his unpacking of the Ten Commandments, he concludes with various laws focused on maintaining a holy community. 

While basically all of the final six commandments are addressed in some way, the commandments against stealing and coveting seem to get the most attention. 

These commands begin with a lengthy section about keeping the land and people pure. Purity is maintained by excluding unacceptable groups from full-fledged membership in Israel's religious community (Deuteronomy 23:1). Even when the army camps out during war, they must keep themselves pure; going as far as burying their waste underground (Deuteronomy 23:13). 

Next, are commands about fairness in the community. Israel must act with equity because that is also one of the ways they keep themselves and their land pure. 

The point of all these laws is not to earn God’s favor. Israel already has that. It is also not to prevent God’s wrath. These laws are about maintaining the relationship Israel has with God. 

Listen to the reason Moses gives for why men in the army must bury their own excrement. It’s because God walks among them (Deuteronomy 23:14). Purity is important because God’s presence is important. 

So when we read rules about honest business practices, caring for widows, and protecting slaves, we need to remember what was at stake - the presence of God. 

Where is the Gospel? 

What makes the good news of Jesus so good is not that these requirements are taken off of us. It’s not that we no longer have to treat one another with dignity and defend the defenseless. If anything, Jesus intensified these commands (Matthew 25:42). 

The good news of Jesus is that he does both the purifying and the protecting, the cleansing and the caring. Like Israel’s atoning sacrifices, Jesus’ blood makes us completely pure. Even though we deserved to be excluded from his assembly because of all our uncleanness, Jesus cleans us up once and for all (Hebrews 10:22). 

But he also gives us his Spirit to move us toward the widow, the orphan, and the slave (John 13:34). This is why the New Testament can say that it is God who wills and acts within us for his good pleasure (Philippians 2:13). 

Jesus saves us by his blood and then uses us to act out these laws to our own communities. Our actions aren’t the cause of his purification, his purification is the cause of our actions. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who loves both purity and justice. And that you would see Jesus as the only one who can accomplish both in our lives."

Moses’ speech to the people on the border of the Promised Land continues. This passage is full of warnings and commands. 

He warns them about three things that will cause Israel to forget God and what he’s done when they enter the land: affluence, idolatry, and hardship. 

Israel is also instructed against forming three different types of relationships with the inhabitants of the land: political, social, or religious (7:2b-3). No treaties, no marriages, and definitely no following their faith practices.

How is Israel supposed to obey all these commands and warnings? The same answer is repeated throughout this passage. Remember what God has done. 

The most beautiful act God tells Israel to remember is why he chose them out of all the other nations. He did not choose them because they were the biggest, strongest, and best (7:7). In fact, they were the smallest and weakest. God chose Israel because he loves them (7:8). And he loves them for no other reason than that he chose to love them. 

And when the people remember this fact, something should happen in their hearts. They love God in return. God’s love for Israel, should create Israel's love for God. And this love will lead them to obey. 

This is best summed up in one of the most famous and important lines in the whole Old Testament. It says, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might” (6:4-5). 

Love is the center of the law. 

Where is the Gospel? 

When Jesus was asked what the most important command was, he didn’t answer with any of the Ten Commandments (Mat 22:36). He didn’t mention warnings against money, false gods, or suffering. His response wasn’t about politics, social programs, or religious reform. 

His answer was this verse in Deuteronomy. The greatest command is to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mat 22:37). 

This is the greatest command because love is the only force that can cause us to obey every other law. Loving God does not make our obedience to the other commands unnecessary, it makes our obedience possible.  

How do we cultivate our love for God? The same way Israel was called to do it. By remembering that God chose us, not because we were smarter, better, or more worthy than anyone else. He saved us just because he loves us. And his love was not just an emotion. His love was an action that took him all the way to the cross. 

So by the time we get to Jesus’ second most important command, to “love others,” we actually have the ability to obey it. We can love others because he first loved us (1 Jn 4:19). And this love fulfills the whole law (Gal 5:14).  

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who loves us before we love him, and that you would see Jesus as the one who has shown his love for us in such a dramatic way that when we see it we will be changed to obey God and love others."

Moses is currently giving the Israelites instructions on how to obey the Ten Commandments once they enter the Promised Land and drive out the inhabitants. 

This section seems to focus most on the fourth commandment - remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. 

Israel is to rest every seven days. But there are broader rhythms in their calendar that help them remember as well.

Every seventh year is a sabbatical year. Israel must release all Hebrew slaves and forgive all Hebrew debts (15:2). The purpose of this sabbatical year is definitely about justice for the poor and equity for the people (15:7), but Moses says something else is going on as well. 

When an Israelite releases a bondservant or forgives a debt they are enacting a smaller version of what God did for them in Egypt. They were slaves and God set them free. So when the Sabbatical Year comes, Israel gets to remember and reenact the freedom God gave them by extending it to one another (15:15). 

This isn’t the only thing on Israel’s calendar other than the weekly Sabbath. There are other festivals that take place every single year: Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths. 

All of these festivals, though different, serve the same purpose. Moses repeats it multiple times (16:3). They remind Israel that they used to be slaves in Egypt, but God rescued them (16:12). 

Remembering God’s grace leads to loving God. And loving God leads to obeying God. In this instance, obedience looks like treating the poor and enslaved among them with mercy, as God treated them when they were poor and enslaved.  

Where is the Gospel?  

The same is true for Christians today. Except we aren’t called to remember when Israel was enslaved in Egypt, but when we were enslaved to sin and death (Eph 2:1). 

One of the visible reminders we have been given is the Lord’s Supper. In it, we remember that Jesus’ body and blood paid for our sin and saved us from death (Luke 22:19). 

But we don’t observe yearly or weekly festivals anymore, because all of them pointed to Jesus who has now fulfilled them (Col 2:17). 

Jesus is the final day of Sabbath rest because in him all work is done (Heb 4:9). Jesus is the final Passover because in him the last sacrifice needed has been made (1 Cor 5:7). 

We can constantly rest in the completed work of Jesus day by day and hour by hour (Mat 11:28). We can take regular sabbath rest just by remembering Jesus and his completed work. 

And as we remember how we were slaves and Jesus saved us from death, we will love him and obey him. And one of the main things he tells us to do out of love for him is to love the poor and enslaved around us (John 13:34).

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God whose salvation changes our hearts, and that you would see Jesus as the one who has provided full salvation to make a people with fully changed hearts."

Moses continues to unpack the Ten Commandments for the people of Israel before they enter the promised land. In this section he may even be focusing most sharply on the sixth command: you shall not murder. 

That’s because murder disrespects human life. So when Moses goes to unpack this commandment, he finds himself talking about all the ways God wants us to respect the life and dignity of others. 

He goes into how to atone for unsolved murders, how female captors are to be treated fairly (Deuteronomy 21:14), how to protect a son from an unfair father and how to protect a father from an unruly son. The laws continue to cover things like caring for and returning your neighbor’s possessions when you find them and the severe punishment for men accused of rape (Deuteronomy 22:26). 

But even small issues about respecting life are found here. People must be sure to put railing around their roofs so that people don’t fall off and injure themselves (Deuteronomy 22:8). Even birds are protected. An Israelite may take the eggs of a bird, but not the mother too (Deuteronomy 22:6). In a sense, respect for life and justice extends to the animal kingdom. 

Two key features come up throughout these commands. First, is God’s desire for fairness, equity, and justice. He provided women, children, and foreigners with protections and rights unknown to other societies in the ancient world. 

The second feature is God’s determination to keep Israel and her land pure. Again and again the phrase, “purge evil from your midst” is repeated when talking about why Israel must obey these commands and their punishments (Deuteronomy 22:22b). 

Sin must be punished. Bloodguilt must be covered. Evil must be driven out. 

That is because God is making his dwelling with these people. And if they don’t purge the evil from their midst, God will. 

Where is the Gospel? 

The good news of Jesus is that when he comes and makes his dwelling with us he does purge us of all evil and guilt (1 John 1:9). He doesn’t wait until we clean ourselves up, but he comes and does it for us. 

God’s value of human life, talked about in this passage, is seen in at least two powerful ways in the Gospel.  

First, God became a human life. Second, he who prohibits murder and fights for the preservation of life, allowed himself to be murdered and did not perserve his own life. 

But because he did, he can now come and dwell within us through the Holy Spirit and work, day by day, to actually make us into people who treat one another with the respect he has for human life.

In fact, he saves sinners like us by his righteousness.",Website,Deuteronomy Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

God did not choose the people of Israel because they were good, righteous, or had a lot of faith (9:4). They are not receiving the Promised Land because of their own goodness. There are, however, two reasons why God is sending Israel into Canaan to drive out the inhabitants: 1. The inhabitants are evil, and 2. God promised their ancestor Abraham (9:5). God’s justice and faithfulness account for Israel being chosen, not their own goodness. 

To help get the people’s heads around just how sinful they are, Moses retells the story of the Golden Calf from Exodus (9:16). They constructed a false god in the presence of the one true God. That’s how sinful they are. 

And yet, God is still bringing them into the promised land. That’s how faithful he is. 

Then God instructs the people to do something based on how sinful they are. He tells them to circumcise the foreskin of their hearts (10:16). Circumcision was a sign of God’s covenant with Abraham. For a male to be circumcised was to say that he was a part of the family line God had promised to bless (Genesis 17:10). 

But even though they were part of God’s covenant people according to the flesh, they were not acting like it according to their hearts. 

So God calls for both men and women to make a deeper distinction. To cut the stubbornness out of their hearts and act like his covenant people by loving him fully (6:5). 

But how do you circumcise your heart? Moses says by it is by meditating on the words of Deuteronomy (11:18). Remembering God’s salvation, God’s judgment, and God’s commands should cut stubbornness out of the heart. 

However, Israel was unable to circumcise their hearts. In fact, like their rescue from Egypt and their takeover of the Promised Land, this is only something God can do (29:4). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Like Israel, Jesus does not save us because we are good, righteous, or deserving. We are just like the grumbling, stubborn Israelites. We worship false gods, right in God’s face. We should not have been saved. But Jesus saves us anyway.

Furthermore, Jesus sends the Spirit to work within us to circumcise our hearts and gives us new ones that are capable of obeying him (Rom 2:29). Anytime you as a Christian obey instead of disobey, that is the work of the Holy Spirit. 

In the same way that we are not saved because of our righteousness, we do not do good because of our own righteousness either (Gal 3:3). Both our initial salvation and our ongoing sanctification are an act of grace. And these gracious new hearts make us walk in every good work God has prepared for us (Eph. 2:10).  

So how do we join the Holy Spirit in this internal operation? We do what Moses told the Israelites to do: remember. Set your mind on the final Word of God, Jesus (Col 3:2). Meditate on how he saved you, even though you didn’t deserve it. And when you do, your heart will continue to be molded into one that loves God fully and completely (2 Cor 3:18). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who saves the undeserving and gives them good work to do. And that you would see Jesus as the one who gives us new hearts fit for every good work."

He takes the eye for eye punishment our law breaking requires and turns us into law. keepers who can enact justice in our world.",Website,Deuteronomy Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

Moses has covered the first five commandments, and now starts unpacking the final five - murder, adultery, stealing, lying, and coveting. 

When it comes to murder, what is Israel to do when someone is accidentally killed? A distinction is made between premeditated murder and accidental killing (Deuteronomy 19:4). For those who murder, the penalty is death. But for those who are involved in an accidental death, a city of refuge is provided where they can flee and be safe. 

What about lying? If a liar is caught trying to get someone punished for a thing they didn’t do in court, then the liar himself is sentenced to the very punishment he was trying to put on someone else (Deuteronomy 19:19). Eye for eye, tooth for tooth. 

Then there is stealing and coveting which is covered in the rules about spoils of war. The armies must devote everything to destruction when they take cities in the promised land (Deuteronomy 20:16). But  spoils may be taken from cities outside the promised land. Israel must show restraint and not covet or steal that which God has devoted to destruction. 

In these commands, we see that God is concerned about protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty. These are not at odds with each other, but are two sides of the same coin. That coin is justice. 

But neither us nor our societies have protected the innocent or punished evil perfectly. 

Where is the Gospel? 

This is why the Gospel is such bafflingly good news. Jesus is both the just and the justifier (Romans 3:26). 

He is the justifier because he has put us in good legal standing before God. But he is still just because our punishment did not go undealt (Romans 3:25). Jesus took our full punishment, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, onto himself. 

In a way, he protected the guilty and punished the innocent. We who were guilty have been protected because he who was innocent was punished. 

He is both sides of the coin of justice. 

He is our city of refuge, where even murderers can hide from penalty (Romans 8:1). He was the one who was lied about in court, but who took the penalty for liars (Matthew 26:59). He had every right to devote the world to destruction, but instead conquered the world on the cross and made us his spoils (John 3:16).  

Now that we have been justified freely by him, we have experienced the grace necessary to live a life that does obey these last five commandments. Because of the love Jesus has shown us, and him living in us, we can be loving, chaste, honest, generous, and content. And we can affect the societies we live in to act the same way by sharing with them this just and justifying love of Jesus (1 Peter 2:12). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who protects the innocent and judges the guilty. And that you would see Jesus as the one who took our guilt so that we could be protected from what we deserved."

Moses is continuing his speech to Israel before they enter the Promised Land. Here, he starts explaining what the Ten Commandments will look like when they are lived out in Israel’s new home. 

The first two he unpacks are: (1) to have no other gods but Yahweh and (2) to not make idols. 

The inhabitants of Canaan worship idols and practice child sacrifice. Israel must not be influenced or swayed by any of these practices. 

So, God provides a kind of three-step program for how to keep the first two commandments in the midst of all this false religion. 

First, the people must destroy every religious site and image in their conquest of the land (12:3). 

Second, the people are to worship and sacrifice only at the place God shows them to set up his temple (12:5). 

Third, if an Israelite starts following other gods, that person must be killed (13:5). They are guilty of the same sin that the inhabitants of the land are guilty of, and so they fall under the same punishment. 

Even if it is a prophet who has made correct predictions, even if it is your own mother, wife, or closest friend, even if it is an entire city, the sentence is the same (13:6). They must be put to death. 

All of us fail to obey the first two commands. Even for many of us who don’t practice pagan religions, we do worship our internal idols of self and sin. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Which is why it is such good news that Jesus completed all three of these steps for us, making us able to finally obey the first two commandments. 

Jesus did not just put an end to earthly places of false worship. He actually overcame the power behind them. By dying for our sins on the cross and rising in victory from the dead, “He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him” (Col. 2:15). Jesus frees us, not just from the external influence of people worshipping other gods, but from the actual spiritual power behind these rival beings. 

Secondly, Jesus has also become the final and only chosen place of worship (John 4:24). In an unexpected twist, Jesus doesn’t destroy other religion’s physical places of worship but predicts Israel’s temple will be destroyed (Mat 24:2). But not before allowing the temple of his own body to be destroyed (John 2:21). Now, the only proper place to worship is in Christ. He is our temple. He is our way to God.  

Finally, we still have to watch out for people who would teach any good news other than the Gospel of Jesus (Gal 1:8). But those who have trusted Jesus and have the Spirit of God inside them have been given the promise of perseverance (2 Cor 1:21-22). God will keep them from being swayed and tempted by tricksters and deceivers. God’s people will persevere. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who not only shows us how to obey his commands, but provides us with every way to obey them in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ."

After all the laws are given, the people are told how to respond. 

Once they enter the land, God wants them to take some of the land’s first fruits and bring it to the temple and offer it to God (Deuteronomy 26:2). Along with the offering, the worshipper is to recite the story of their deliverance from Egypt. This ritual was to happen every three years, as a constant reminder of what God had done for them and what he requires of them in his law (Deuteronomy 26:12). 

Next, comes a long list of blessings followed by a longer list of curses. If Israel keeps the law they will receive all the blessings listed. If they disobey the law, they will receive all the curses. 

The blessings make Israel’s future sound like the perfect mix of the Garden of Eden and the promises made to Abraham. The land they live in will produce all the food they need (Deuteronomy 28:4). Their children will multiply and be healthy. And they will rise in power over every other nation, extending the blessing they receive to the whole world (Deuteronomy 28:10). 

The curses, on the other hand, sound like a deadly mix of the plagues from Exodus and the punishments from Numbers. If Israel doesn’t keep the laws they will experience locusts, darkness, death, and desolation like Egypt before them (Deuteronomy 28:27). They will also receive intensified versions of the punishments that came to their parents as they traveled through the wilderness - fire, disease, and wild animals will all devour them (Deuteronomy 28:22). 

The longest and most emphasized curse has to do with a rival kingdom God will raise up to come and punish them. This kingdom, that does not worship Yahweh, will take them captive and force them to worship their false gods (Deuteronomy 28:52). 

And since Israel did not obey the law, all these curses came true. Israel was taken away by rival kingdoms like Babylon and were exiled from the promised land (Daniel 1:1). 

Where is the Gospel? 

This is our story as well. We have broken God’s law and will receive all these curses as well. Some of us may escape them in this life, but God is not a liar. Justice will be done against all who commit evil. 

After reading all these curses, the Gospel shines through as really good news. All of these curses we deserved, Jesus bore in his flesh on the cross. In fact, he became the curse for us (Galatians 3:13). 

Now, we can read the blessings promised and look forward to them instead of what we deserve. We will inherit every blessing promised in this text and more (2 Corinthians 1:20). We will enter the new and final garden of Eden in the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21:1). We will be free from death, disease, and pain (Revelation 21:4). Best of all, we will be with Jesus. That’s what really makes the land good. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who offers outlandish and lavish blessings, but maintains perfect and severe justice. And that you would see Jesus as the one who takes our severity and extends to us lavishness."

Saul is hunting David. One day, he just so happens to relieve himself in the same cave where David is hiding (1 Samuel 24:3). All David’s men whisper that God has delivered Saul on a platter (1 Samuel 24:4). But as David crouches toward Saul with a knife—and even cuts off a piece of his robe—he feels guilty (1 Samuel 24:5). Even though David has been anointed and will be king, he can't attack God’s chosen king (1 Samuel 24:6).

Instead, David walks out of the cave and bows to Saul. He asks why Saul is attacking him. The robe in his hand is proof David means him no harm (1 Samuel 24:11). The ripped robe should remind Saul of when he ripped the prophet Samuel’s robe. Samuel prophesied that the kingdom would be ripped away from Saul and handed to someone more noble (1 Samuel 24:19). The robe in noble David’s hand signals Saul’s quickly approaching demise (1 Samuel 15:27-28; 24:20). 

David then meets a bad-tempered ruler named Nabal (1 Samuel 25:2-3). His name means “fool” (1 Samuel 25:25). He’s a stand-in for the rich and foolish king Saul—and refuses to recognize David as God’s anointed (1 Samuel 25:10). David protects Nabal’s property and employees (1 Samuel 25:7), but Nabal refuses to return the favor (1 Samuel 25:11).

In anger, David gathers his army. But Nabal’s wife Abigail approaches David and warns him that revenge is not the way God saves (1 Samuel 25:26). This military attempt at self-salvation will only cause guilt, just like David experienced in the cave (1 Samuel 25:31). Abigail reminds David that God will deal with wicked king Nabal by his own hand, not David’s. And sure enough, David waits and Nabal dies from a mysterious illness (1 Samuel 25:39).

When David is given another chance to kill Saul, he repeats what he said in the cave about not attacking the Lord’s anointed (1 Samuel 26:9). But he’s also learned Abigail’s lesson. David knows God’s hand will kill Saul, not his own (1 Samuel 26:10). So David’s last recorded words to king Saul are confident. He knows God will rescue him and tear down Saul. Soon, he will take the throne (1 Samuel 26:24).

Where is the Gospel?

David has three opportunities to take revenge on his enemies through stealth or force, but in each case he doesn’t. At first it’s out of guilt, then because of Abigail’s wise intervention, and finally in confidence that God will fight his battles. David doesn’t need to resort to the tactics Saul used against him. Abigail called those tactics self-salvation (1 Samuel 25:31). God will enthrone David and judge Saul’s evil (1 Samuel 25:29b). Instead of getting even, David must humbly entrust his battles and enemies to God’s justice in God’s timing if he wants to take the throne of God’s Kingdom. 

On the cross, Jesus does the same. Jesus did not seek vengeance against an ungrateful world that refused to acknowledge him. He didn’t look for ways to get even with those who opposed him. Instead he forgave and died for them (Luke 23:34). Just as David waited and allowed Saul’s evil to keep him on the run, Jesus waited on God’s justice in God’s timing—even when that meant allowing evil and violence to kill him.

Instead of saving himself, Jesus waited in death (Matthew 27:42). But just as God would avenge Saul’ evil and place David on Israel’s throne, God also avenged Jesus by raising him from the dead and seating him on a heavenly throne (Ephesians 1:20). 

Jesus’ ascension proves that refusing to save ourselves and instead waiting on God’s justice is how our enemies are defeated and how we will reign (Ephesians 2:6). God’s justice means that our enemies of death, pride, foolishness, and sin are crucified on the cross. And God’s justice means that those who wait are raised with Jesus to eternal life and heavenly power (Romans 6:5-6). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who saves by his own hand. And may you see Jesus as the one who defeats our enemies and raises us to power by waiting on God."

In this part of his speech to Israel, Moses reminds the people that God has chosen them (14:2). More than that, Israel is God’s possession because he has rescued them from Egypt. This makes Israel holy to God. She must be distinct, set apart, and different. 

Seeing Israel as holy to God is necessary if we are going to understand the food laws in this passage. These laws allow Israel to eat certain animals, but forbid them from eating others (14:3). Israel has been chosen by God, so they are only to eat the food that has been chosen by God. Israel’s diet was a symbol of their status as chosen, and the rest of the nations as unchosen (14:21). 

So, even in the kitchen, Israel has a daily reminder that they are set apart and chosen exclusively to Yahweh. 

After the food laws, Moses gives commands about tithes. When we think about tithes, many of us start thinking about money. But, Moses is still talking about food (14:22). Every year, each family is supposed to take a tenth of their harvest, go to God’s temple, and throw a feast with joy before Yahweh. If the journey is too long to travel with all that food, then the family can sell the food, bring the money to God’s temple, and buy their favorite food and drinks for the feast (14:26). 

God doesn’t only want food to be a reminder of how Israel is set apart to take the new land, but also how God has given Israel things to enjoy in the new land. Enjoying God’s blessings with thankfulness is one of the main ways God reminds us to fear and remember him. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus also used food as a way of reminding Christians that we are set apart to no one else but him. 

In the book of Acts, we learn that the symbol of chosen and unchosen food is no longer needed because all nations are invited to be God’s people (Acts 10:15). That is because the wall that divided Israel from all other nations was destroyed in the cross by Jesus earning the promises of Israel to all people (Eph 2:14). So for Christians, our unrestricted diet needs to daily remind us of God’s unrestricted grace. Where Israel’s diet should have reminded them of their task to drive the nations out, each time we eat we should remember our task to call all nations in (1 Cor 9:21). 

The New Testament also constantly calls us to eat with gratitude (1 Cor 10:31). God’s presence is no longer separated to one location because the Holy Spirit now lives in all believers. So we can eat every meal before the Lord. Each bite can become a celebration like the tithe. Not only do we remember the physical blessings of food, but symbolically we taste and see that the Lord is good (Ps 34:8). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who graciously reminds us who and whose we are through things like food. And that you would see Jesus as the one who allows us to partake of the spiritual blessings of Israel and be reminded of them daily through the physical act of something as simple as eating."

In the middle of a long military campaign against the Philistines, God rejects Saul as king (1 Samuel 16:1a). Israel needs a new leader who will listen to God’s voice. So God sends Samuel to find and anoint a replacement from Jesse’s family (1 Samuel 16:1b). At first, Samuel is tempted to make the same mistake Israel made before. He wants to anoint the oldest and tallest son (1 Samuel 16:6). But God reminds Samuel that he’s not looking for someone who’s impressive on the outside; he’s looking at people’s hearts (1 Samuel 16:7) . 

David, the youngest, smallest, and most easily forgotten son, is God’s chosen king (1 Samuel 16:11-12). Samuel anoints him and God’s Spirit rushes on him (1 Samuel 16:13). In the very next verse that same Spirit leaves Saul and and is replaced with an evil spirit (1 Samuel 16:14). Saul’s no longer just at war with the Philistines. He’s at war with God. 

The only relief Saul can find from the evil spirit is when Spirit-filled David plays music (1 Samuel 16:18, 23). David battles Saul’s demons and wins. It’s proof that David is God’s chosen king, and foreshadows David’s upcoming battle with the other enemy Saul can’t shake—the Philistines.

Saul had moved his war with the Philistines away from Israel's heartland and onto the Philistine/Israeli border (1 Samuel 17:1). In response, the Philistines gathered their forces and sent out a champion named Goliath (1 Samuel 17:4). His name means “giant.” And like Saul, he stands head and shoulders above his peers (1 Samuel 9:2). The Philistines offer an ultimatum. If Israel’s “giant” Saul can kill Goliath, they’ll surrender. But if Goliath wins, Israel will become their slaves (1 Samuel 17:9). Terrified, Saul hides for 40 days (1 Samuel 17:16). 

But David doesn’t look at Goliath’s outward appearance (1 Samuel 17:28). David sees Goliath as nothing more than the wild animals he’s dealt with before (1 Samuel 17:26). He’ll tame the Philistine beast the same way he tamed the Saul’s evil spirit (1 Samuel 17:37). Dressed more like a shepherd and a musician than a warrior, David battles Goliath and wins (1 Samuel 17:40, 50). 

Just like Saul’s anointing was proved when he battled the Ammonites, David’s anointing is validated by defeating Saul’s enemy. David doesn’t just defeat Goliath, he also defeats the king who stood head and shoulders above him. David is God’s chosen king. And like Goliath, Saul will soon fall at David’s feet. 

Where is the Gospel?

The story of David and Goliath is one of the most famous stories in the Bible. It marks the beginning of both Saul’s fall and David’s rise to power. It also shows us how different these two men are. Saul is tall, David is small. Saul hides, David is brave. Saul rejects God’s leadership, but David trusts God with his life. Saul is afflicted by a spirit, David is filled with God’s Spirit. Saul has the throne, but David has the heart of a king.

In some ways, this story is about the type of people and leaders we should be— Davids in a world of Sauls! But more importantly it describes the type of Savior we need. 

Head and shoulders above us, and armed to the teeth, political forces and cultural animosity rule. But our real enemies are the evil spirits that oppress us, torment our thoughts, whisper conspiracies about the people around us, and convince us we’re worthless (Ephesians 6:12). We need a King to fight the battles we can’t. 

And that King is David’s son, Jesus. There was nothing impressive about Jesus’ physical appearance, but he had the heart of God (Isaiah 52:13-14). He bravely went to battle against the rulers, principalities, and powers, trusting God even when it meant his life (Colossians 2:15). 

But filled with God’s Spirit and dressed in grave clothes rather than armor, Jesus battles death and wins. Jesus’ victory proves he’s not just King of Israel, but of life and death (Romans 14:9). Jesus has slayed our giants, and now stands head and shoulders above them all. So come, victory and peace are yours in Jesus. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has chosen our King. And may you see Jesus as the anointed one who defeats our enemies and brings victory and peace."

David is about to unite Israel into one kingdom and centralize power in one city—Jerusalem.

The northern tribes, who had been loyal to Saul, recognize and anoint David as the rightful heir to Israel’s throne (2 Samuel 5:3). But David realizes he can’t unite all of Israel from his military base in the far south. So David takes his newly united armies and marches toward the central city of Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:6a). The Jebusites who ruled Jerusalem expected to beat David easily (2 Samuel 5:6b). But God was with David (2 Samuel 5:10). Not only does he win the city, he builds a palace (2 Samuel 5:11). His family grows and Solomon is born. Solomon will be the son to carry on David’s dynasty after his death (2 Samuel 5:14).

David also defeats the Philistines who had plagued Israel since Saul’s reign. Fearful of a united kingdom, the Philistines send a battalion to the old border between Judah in the south and Israel in the north (2 Samuel 5:18). They hope a loss for David will mean the end of David’s unified Israel. But with God’s voice and power guiding him, David defeats the Philistines, defends the heartland, and secures the unity of Israel (2 Samuel 5:25). Israel is finally united and free because God is with them. 

And as a powerful symbol of God’s presence, David brings God’s ark to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6:2). David is making Jerusalem not simply the political center of Israel but the religious center too. David is setting up a kingdom where God’s presence and word are central. But God’s presence is dangerous. 

As David’s men cart the ark to Jerusalem, a man touches God’s throne and dies (2 Samuel 6:7). It’s a humbling reminder that God’s power and presence can’t be taken for granted (2 Samuel 6:9). God’s presence is sacred and needs to be treated as such. Recognizing his error, David carries the ark into Jerusalem with sacrifices and songs of worship (2 Samuel 6:13-14).

But Saul’s daughter Michal is not impressed (2 Samuel 6:16). Like her father she doesn’t understand the necessity of listening and waiting on God’s word and presence. She confronts David for what she thinks is shameful behavior (2 Samuel 6:20). And David tells her she’s wrong (2 Samuel 6:21). His priorities are exactly as they should be. From that moment Michal is unable to have children (2 Samuel 6:23). There will never be a child from Saul’s line in Israel again.

Where is the Gospel?

Up to this point the Israelites have been nomads. They wandered in the desert, and then wandered through enemy-occupied Canaan. For generations they’ve been waiting for this moment. Israel has never had a capital like Jerusalem before— and God’s presence sits in the middle of it. God rules his people as they hoped and king David listens to him. And as a result Israel experiences a newfound peace and unity.

The New Testament reminds us that we’re all still wanderers. The book of Hebrews says we’re all looking for a city that is to come (Hebrews 13:14). In our suffering we want a situation that’s not like the one we’re in. Some of us fantasize about selling it all and giving into our wanderlust, searching for that place that feels like home. 

That’s why the Bible describes heaven as a New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:2). Heaven is our nomadic soul’s final home. It’s not just the place where God’s throne dwells, but God himself is there (Revelation 21:3). We’ll be able to look and see a King better than David—Jesus! And unlike the man who died when he touched God’s ark, God will touch our face. He will gently wipe the tears from our eyes (Revelation 21:4). We won’t only be at peace from our enemies, but also at total peace with God and the world. One day God will tell us that the death and pain are over. Jesus, the son of David and the King of New Jerusalem, will take us by the hand and bring us home.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who gives his people a King and a city. And may you see Jesus as the King who will finally make us feel at home."

First Samuel 13-15 answers the question, “Why did God reject Saul as king?”

The simplest answer is that God rejected Saul because Saul rejected God. More specifically, Saul rejected God’s word delivered by Samuel, God’s prophet. Right before Saul’s battle against the Philistines, Saul does not wait for Samuel as he is instructed. Instead, Saul disobeys and offers a sacrifice by himself (1 Samuel 13:9).

Because Saul refuses to listen to God, Samuel says he has forfeited the hope of an eternal dynasty in Israel (1 Samuel 13:13). His son Jonathan will not sit on the throne after him, but instead it will be someone who is “after God’s own heart” (1 Samuel 13:14). This is a shame because Jonathan would have been a better king than Saul.

Outnumbered and out-armoured, Jonathan bravely goes into battle, trusting God against the impossible odds (1 Samuel 14:6). At the same time Jonathan listens to God, Saul replaces God’s prophet with Ahijah. He’s the grandson of the unfaithful priest Eli and the nephew of Ichabod, whose name literally means “God’s glory has departed” (1 Samuel 14:21). Saul has surrounded himself with people opposed to God’s voice.

While Jonathan’s faith in God secures him a miraculous victory (1 Samuel 14:14-15), Saul rushes into battle and rashly enforces a fast among his soldiers without even consulting his false priest (1 Samuel 14:19, 24). His impetuous leadership means that Israel’s starving army ends up sinning when they finally eat (1 Samuel 14:33).

Even more tragic, when Saul finally tries to pray, God refuses to answer (1 Samuel 14:37). And instead of recognizing his own sin, Saul blames Jonathan for God’s silence and tries to kill him (1 Samuel 14:44-45). All these problems repeat in Saul’s battle against the Amalakites when Saul disobeys another command from God (1 Samuel 15:9).

When confronted by Samuel, Saul pretends his motives were honorable (1 Samuel 15:21). But Samuel tells Saul that he misses the point. God wants his obedience (1 Samuel 15:22). And Saul’s consistent failure to obey means the kingdom will be ripped from his hands and given to someone more worthy (1 Samuel 15:28).

Where is the Gospel?

God rejected Saul because Saul rejected God’s word. Saul’s story is supposed to make us desperate for a King who both shares God’s heart and listens to God’s voice (1 Samuel 13:14).

This new King needs to prayerfully act, not impetuously react. This King needs to take responsibility for sins, and not pass the buck. This King needs to feed his people, not starve them. This King needs to accept God and his will rather than reject it when it gets difficult. This King needs to listen to God and his word so that he knows how and when to sacrifice.

And that King is Jesus. Jesus obeyed God’s word and fulfilled every command (Matthew 5:17). His heart and God’s heart are the same (Hebrews 1:1-2). Jesus did nothing without prayerfully waiting for God’s direction (John 5:19). Like a good leader, he took responsibility for sins he did not commit (2 Corinthians 5:21). Jesus accepted God’s word even when it meant sacrificing himself (Luke 22:19, 42). Saul rejected God’s word, but Jesus was God’s word perfectly lived (John 1:14). And now Jesus rules forever at God’s right hand (Acts 7:56).

So don’t be like Saul who lost God’s kingdom. Accept God’s word—both his commands and his Word made flesh in Jesus. When we accept King Jesus, we will gain a Kingdom that lasts forever.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who loves obedience. And may you see Jesus as our obedient King who rules forever."

Like David, Jesus is God's anointed king, betrayed by those closest to him.",Website,1 & 2 Samuel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

David failed to protect Tamar—his daughter and Absalom’s sister. And for four years Absalom has plotted revenge and conspired to overthrow his father. Even recruiting David’s royal counselor Ahithophel to his side (2 Samuel 15:6b-7, 12). 

Overnight, Absalom rallies his supporters and marches towards the throne. David is forced from Jerusalem and makes several strategic decisions (2 Samuel 15:14). David refuses to take the ark from Jerusalem for his benefit (2 Samuel 15:25). He enlists some priests as spies and chooses a rendezvous point to share information (2 Samuel 15:27-28). He also sends Hushai as a double agent to counter the traitorous and viciously intelligent Ahithophel (2 Samuel 15:34; 16:23). 

With David on the run, Ahithophel counsels Absalom to sleep with his father’s concubines on the roof of the palace (2 Samuel 16:21-22). It’s a symbol of domination over his father. But it’s also David’s sin with Bathsheba coming full circle, and Nathan’s prophecy coming true (2 Samuel 12:11).

Immediately, Ahithophel advises Absalom to strike fast and hard before David has a chance to regroup (2 Samuel 17:1-2). But David’s double agent manages to convince Absalom that it’s wiser to wait (2 Samuel 17:14). Hushai immediately sends the spies to relay this news, giving David the time he needs to regroup and strategize (2 Samuel 17:16; 18:1). 

The victory is immediate. Absalom retreats and accidentally hangs himself in a tree. He is killed by Joab, who first offers pieces of silver to another man to do the deed (2 Samuel 18:14). 

Despite Absalom’s treachery, David grieves over the loss of his son until his responsibilities as commander-in-chief force him into action once again (2 Samuel 19:3-4). David enters back into Jerusalem and makes several strategic decisions concerning his kingdom. He also learns that Absalom’s rebellion stirred up an old feud between Northern Israel and Southern Judah (2 Samuel 19:41). As with Absalom, a new rebellion rallies overnight, led by a man named Sheba. He doesn’t want David’s throne, but to divide the kingdom David has unified (2 Samuel 20:6). Joab corners Sheba in a town called Abel. And just as David’s first conflict with Absalom was resolved by a wise woman, it’s the words of another wise woman that finally ends Absalom’s rebellion (2 Samuel 14:2, 20:14-15).

Where is the Gospel?

In his Gospel, the apostle Matthew is careful to describe Judas’ betrayal of Jesus like Absalom’s betrayal of David. Both Absalom and Judas betray their king with a kiss, hang themselves, and are buried in pits (2 Samuel 14:33). And pieces of silver are crucial parts of both Absalom and Judas’ deaths. A bystander refused to lay a hand on Absalom, the king’s son, for even a 1,000 pieces of silver offered by Joab (2 Samuel 18:12). Judas prices his loyalty to David’s greatest son for only 30 (Matthew 26:15). 

Matthew understands Jesus as the truest and final King David. Like David, Jesus is God’s anointed king, betrayed by those closest to him.

All of us have put a price on our loyalty to the King of the Universe—perhaps not with silver like Judas, but maybe with the same long-harbored anger Absalom had towards God. Most of us believe that if we were in charge, we’d do it differently. And so we live bitter lives according to our sense of justice. We earn the title of traitor. 

But the good news is that like David, Jesus wants to take the place of traitorous sons. Jesus doesn’t hold Judas’ betrayal against him or kill him for his treason. Instead, he allows Judas’ rebellion to win. Jesus dies like a traitor to Rome, so that traitors like Judas can live. And like the wise women at the tomb announced to the disciples, Jesus is risen! (Luke 24:6, 10). Our treachery is forever buried. And in grace, Jesus promises to lift humbled rebels to the same thrones they try to steal (Revelation 3:21). There is only one King who weeps over traitors, dies for the disloyal, and gives rebels power in his Kingdom. His name is Jesus.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has anointed Jesus as our King. And may you see King Jesus as a merciful King who died so that traitors can live."

The Philistines and the Israelites are at war.

In a devastating loss, the Philistines capture Israel’s symbol for God’s presence—the ark. At first, the Philistines are fearful of fighting the God whom they know defeated the Egyptians. But the captured ark is a trophy that seems to prove their god’s superiority (1 Samuel 4:8). So they place the ark in the temple of their deity Dagon (1 Samuel 5:2). They’ll soon learn, however, God is no one’s trophy.

The next morning, they find their idol fallen over as if bowing in front of the ark (1 Samuel 5:3). They place the statue back, but the next morning they find Dagon decapitated and missing his hands (1 Samuel 5:4). Ironically, we’re told in the next verse and seven more times throughout this story that the hand of the Lord is heavy against the Philistines (1 Samuel 5:6). 

The God who defeated Pharaoh by “stretching out his hand” against Egypt has come for them—and for their god too (Exodus 7:5). Over the course of the next seven months, the Philistines are plagued by tumors and an outbreak of rats. It’s just like Egypt. Panicked and hoping to stop the plagues, the Philistines pass the ark between five of their cities (1 Samuel 5:6). 

Desperate, Dagon’s priests encourage the Philistines to honor Israel’s God. They send the ark back to Israel with golden models of the rats and tumors that have plagued them (1 Samuel 6:5). The Philistines have learned what Pharaoh never did—that God is no one’s trophy (1 Samuel 6:6).

When the ark returns, Israel needs to learn the same lesson. At first Israel is overjoyed and offers sacrifices in praise (1 Samuel 6:15), only to realize 70 lives too late that they’ve mistreated the ark and God’s presence (1 Samuel 6:19). Quickly, Israel repents and asks Samuel to pray for victory against the Philistines (1 Samuel 7:8). Samuel offers a lamb for Israel’s sin, and before the sacrifice can finish burning God grants Israel victory (1 Samuel 7:10). 

Where is the Gospel?

The Philistines thought God’s ark was a trophy to be manipulated to their cause. Israel thought God’s ark could be treated however they wanted. But both nations learned the price of disrespect and dishonoring of God was death.

Like the Philistines, we assume God is on our side in culture wars, and so we use God’s name as a way to justify our position. Or like the Israelites we presume God’s presence means we can act however we like, regardless of what his Word commands.

Co-opting God to our agenda leads to death. True victory over our enemies only comes from repenting and appointing a leader who intercedes on our behalf (1 Samuel 7:6). That leader isn’t Samuel, it’s Jesus. 

The author of Hebrews says that Jesus completely saves those who come to him because his prayers for his people never stop (Hebrews 7:25). Jesus is always interceding for those who appoint him as ruler of their lives. Israel died for inappropriately approaching God’s presence, but when Jesus dies—like Samuel’s lamb—God’s presence approaches us. We become new arks. God makes us living symbols of God’s presence. We’re explicitly told Jesus prays that he will be in us the way the Father was in him (John 17:21b). 

We no longer need to be afraid of the enemies in our world and culture. Jesus has overcome them (John 16:33)! He’s decapitated and removed the hands of every false god, and he now lives in us. And instead of presuming upon God’s presence, he empowers us to come boldly to his throne without fear of death. We can ask for anything we need. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who cannot be manipulated. And may you see Jesus as the one who both intercedes for you and lives in you to grant victory over your enemies."

Since the book of Judges, Israel’s leaders have only gotten worse. But the little boy Samuel will soon replace the wicked leadership of Eli and his sons, Hophni and Phinehas (1 Samuel 2:12). 

Eli’s sons steal the best parts of God’s sacrifices and threaten anyone who tries to stop them (1 Samuel 2:16). But Samuel humbly serves the Lord clothed in robes lovingly made by his mother (1 Samuel 2:18-19). In response, God blesses Samuel but promises to destroy Hophni and Phinehas (1 Samuel 2:25b-26). To confirm God’s purposes, a prophet appears and tells Eli that his family will soon die and their final years will be spent in poverty (1 Samuel 2:31, 36).

Then, after decades of silence, Samuel hears God speak. He humbly listens (1 Samuel 3:1b, 10). Back in Deuteronomy we’re told that prophets are the ones who hear the word of the Lord and communicate it to others (Deuteronomy 18:18). God is calling young Samuel to be Israel’s next prophet. And the word the Lord gives Samuel is the same word of destruction he told Eli privately (1 Samuel 3:14). Eli now knows that Samuel will replace him as Israel’s leader—and soon the whole nation will know it too (1 Samuel 4:1a). 

Hophni and Phinehas are quickly killed in a battle against the Philistines. The ark of the covenant, the place where God’s presence was supposed to live, is taken (1 Samuel 4:11). Eli, the ark’s guardian, dies as soon as he hears the news, leaving Samuel ready to take his place (1 Samuel 4:18). All of God’s words have come true. 

Where is the Gospel?

Eli’s fall and Samuel's rise to power depended on how they responded to the words of the Lord. Eli, because of his failure to obey and teach his sons the Lord’s word, is humbled. But Samuel, even though he had never heard God’s word before, humbly listened and was lifted up (1 Samuel 3:7).

This idea that the right to lead Israel is tied to listening and obeying the word of the Lord is a major theme throughout Samuel. The two major characters in this book, King Saul and King David, will rise and fall based on how they respond to God’s word in the mouth of their prophets, of whom Samuel is the first. 

And in the book of Hebrews we’re told that Jesus is God’s final prophet (Hebrews 1:2). Unlike passive Eli—but very much like faithful Samuel—Jesus perfectly communicates God’s word to us (Hebrews 1:3). So now, our humiliation or our exaltation depends on how we respond to Jesus, God’s Word in the flesh (John 1:14a). 

And like Samuel represented the replacement of a corrupt religious system that took advantage of its members, Jesus and his Kingdom represent the end to every corrupt system, thought, and dark power (Colossians 2:15). Jesus is living proof that even if our humility leads to death, it’s the humble who will be exalted and the proud who will be knocked down. So don’t be like Eli and his sons who pridefully abused God’s word and commands to suit themselves. Instead, humble yourself before the word of the Lord. Jesus promises that when you listen to his voice you will be lifted up.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who speaks. And may you see Jesus as the Word of the Lord who raises the humble and strikes down the proud."

The ending of Samuel can seem confusing. There are two poems, two battle reports, and two strange narratives that don’t seem to connect with one another. But Samuel has carefully paralleled these texts, and each helps us see David as the ideal king of Israel.

At the beginning and end there are two plagues that come against Israel. And both end because of David’s willingness to admit wrong, accept the consequences, and make things right (2 Samuel 21:14, 24:25). Then we have two accounts about several impressive victories won by David’s soldiers (2 Samuel 21:22, 23:8). And the most important fact we’re told about these men is that their strength came from the Lord (2 Samuel 23:12).

Then finally, there are two climactic poems that celebrate God’s presence and power in David’s life, and God’s promise to continue David’s dynasty forever (2 Samuel 22:20, 23:5). One of these poems is even recorded again in Psalm 18.

Being ideal doesn’t mean being perfect. David proudly orders a census of soldiers (2 Samuel 24:2). But he is repentant and forgiven. He listens to God’s voice, and both he and his soldiers rely on God’s power more than their own wisdom and strength. David is Israel’s ideal king because he knows that ultimately he’s not in charge, God is. These final poems, battle reports, and narratives all prove that point.

That’s also why the author isn’t afraid to mention David’s sin (2 Samuel 24:10). David might be an ideal king, but he most certainly isn’t their ultimate King. Besides, David is getting older and weaker (2 Samuel 21:15). So 2 Samuel ends with an invitation not only to imitate David, but to hope that a son of David will rise to power, be like his father, and rule Israel as her next ideal king. 

Where is the Gospel?

It’s hard to overemphasize David’s importance to the Bible’s story. David established Israel as a kingdom, and God promised his sons would rule forever (2 Samuel 7:13). God didn’t promise this to David because he was a perfect king, but because he was a humble king.

Saul lost his kingdom because he pridefully refused to listen to God (1 Samuel 13:15, 15:23b). And the only reason David keeps the kingdom is because his heart is more concerned with honoring God than honoring himself (1 Samuel 16:7). Even when David murdered Uriah and stole his wife, he humbly repents (2 Samuel 12:13). And when David sinfully counts his soldiers, he acknowledges it as treason and throws himself on God’s mercy (2 Samuel 24:10, 14). David knows he’s not Israel’s true monarch. He knows he is subject to the laws of a higher Kingdom (Psalm 51:4). That’s what made him a great king and why Israel thrived under his leadership. The fate of the nation was tied to the humility of its leader. And as David’s story ends, Israel hoped another son of David would take the throne. 

And in Jesus their hope for a humble king comes true. 

Jesus is a son of David who has God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14). Jesus humbly admits that he is subject to a will higher than his own (Matthew 26:39). And since he never sinned, Jesus couldn’t repent or accept the consequences for his own failures. Instead, he humbly took responsibility for ours. This is something David wanted to do but never could (2 Samuel 18:33).

As David watched 70,000 of his own people die because of the proud census he ordered, he begged God to punish him instead of his sheep (2 Samuel 24:17). 

Jesus is the ultimate humble King because he was crucified not for his sins, but ours. And the fate of a nation born from the humble death of its King is resurrection power and an eternal throne. Jesus is not only an ideal King, but a perfect one. All who humbly repent as David did, will live with Jesus forever.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who takes down the proud and lifts up the humble. And may you see Jesus as your humble King, whose death has sealed our place in a Kingdom that will never end."

Amnon, David’s firstborn and the crown prince, sees his beautiful sister Tamar from a distance and “loves” her (2 Samuel 13:1-2). Like his father, Amnon gives in to his lust and rapes his half-sister with the help of his cousin (2 Samuel 13:14). Exhausting his so-called love, Amnon hates Tamar and consigns her to a desolated life (2 Samuel 13:15, 20b). David, hearing his own son is just like him, does nothing (2 Samuel 13:21). 

But Tamar’s brother Absalom (who is also next in line to the throne) silently nurses revenge for two years (2 Samuel 13:22-23). Cunningly, Absalom conspires and murders the man who blocks his path to the throne under the thin disguise of defending his sister’s dignity (2 Samuel 13:28). He even takes a page out of his father’s playbook with Uriah and gets Amnon drunk first.

Again, David hears that his son is just like him and does nothing to enact justice or repair the kingdom (2 Samuel 13:38-39). By judging either Amnon or Absalom, he would be condemning his sons for sins he committed himself. But to forgive Absaolm’s murder would be a misscarraige of justice. So David allows Absalom to run away.

Seeing David’s inability to act, Joab takes a page out of Nathan the prophet’s book (2 Samuel 14:2-3). He hires a woman to tell a story remarkably similar to David’s life (2 Samuel 14:6). Joab hopes he can rouse David to repair his relationship with the crown prince. And just like with Nathan, David’s judgment in the case brought before him is really an indictment of his own leadership (2 Samuel 14:13).

So David invites Absalom back to Jerusalem, but still refuses to see him (2 Samuel 14:24). It will take another two years and an act of arson to force a tense reconciliation (2 Samuel 14:28, 33b).

Where is the Gospel?

Nathan’s prophecy has come true; the sword is not far from David’s house (2 Samuel 12:10). And the violence David began will only deepen throughout the rest of Samuel. The prayerful waiting and decisive action that marked David’s earlier years is gone. Amnon’s lust, Tamar’s rape, and Absalom’s murder go unchecked. David’s sins haunt and paralyze him. 

But Jesus is not like these sons of David. Despite being tempted, Jesus has never abused his people or abdicated his power (Hebrews 4:15). David’s reign was marked by passivity and injustice, but Jesus’ reign begins with a decisive judgment against lust, rape, and violence. Jesus willingly died the way Amnon and Absalom deserved. 

God’s judgment of Jesus shows us that he is a decisive ruler. He will not tolerate the rape of his daughters. He will not allow his sons’ lust for power to go unpunished. Jesus’ death proves that God will by no means clear the guilty (Exodus 34:7). God’s death in Jesus proves there are no limits of judgment for those who reject Jesus as King by their abuse of power and rape. 

If you have been abused, if you are the victim of other’s lust for power, if you feel desolate over the inaction of those you thought you could trust, if you’re oppressed by those in power—Jesus’ death is good news for you. 

It is God’s decisive judgment against those who would harm his daughters and sons. If God’s Son did not escape God’s judgment, how little hope do your oppressors have? And if God’s Son has been raised from the dead, what power can your abusers wield over his coming justice? God’s decisive judgment against evil on the cross is good news for those who have watched abuse swept under the rug. Nothing is hidden from his eyes. God will bring decisive justice.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who decisively judges evil. And may you see Jesus’ death as proof that no evil will ever be left unjudged."

Saul and David are in conflict for the throne of Israel. God has chosen David to be the next king, but Saul will stop at nothing to kill him before that happens. For months David is on the run and makes brief stops in several small Israelite villages. Each stop is further and further from the throne God has promised would one day be his. 

But even as David is forced away from the throne, he still runs toward God. In the town of Nob, David asks a group of priests—descendants of the unfaithful priest Eli—for support and guidance (1 Samuel 22:13). But when Saul arrives looking for David, in his paranoia he massacres all but one of Eli’s priestly descendants (1 Samuel 22:13, 18). 

David flees to the town of Keilah. And even though David isn’t king yet, he acts like one. He risks his life to protect the village from a Philistine raid (1 Samuel 23:5). Saul is king of Keilah, but he doesn’t act like one. When he finds out where David is, he musters his entire army to intimidate the tiny village into surrendering David (1 Samuel 23:7-8). Saul is an unworthy king. He’s descending into jealous madness and violence. 

But it’s all part of God’s slow plan to establish David as the true king of Israel. The Philistines, Israel’s enemies, clearly see this and play an unwitting role. The Philistine king Achish calls David the true king of Israel (1 Samuel 21:11). And when David is cornered by Saul’s armies, the Philistines force Saul to retreat and give David a chance to escape (1 Samuel 23:27-28).

While David is on the run from Saul for now, it’s clear that God is with David and will soon crown him king. God even uses Israel’s enemies to prove it. 

Where is the Gospel?

God is entirely in control of Israel’s religious and political drama. God told the unfaithful priest Eli that his family line would be marked by tragedy (1 Samuel 2:31-33). Saul’s paranoia in Nob fulfilled that prophecy when he murdered 85 of his descendants (1 Samuel 22:19). God has already told Saul that the kingdom would be torn from his hand and given to someone more worthy (1 Samuel 15:28). Saul cannot fight God, which is why David keeps getting away. God knew the advances of the Philistine army would give David a chance to escape (1 Samuel 23:28). p. 

Many Christians’ favorite psalms come from this period in David’s life (Psalm 142:6). Jesus even prayed some of them (Psalm 22:1). The disconnect between being promised a kingdom and being hunted by the most powerful men in Israel demanded that David find comfort in a God whose plans were bigger than the circumstances he could see. David’s psalms frequently express hope that every one of his enemies are on God’s leash (Psalm 2:1, 4). 

It makes sense Jesus prayed these prayers too. Like David he was promised a kingdom, yet hunted by the rulers of his day (Matthew 12:14). Like the worthy king David, Jesus goes into battle and not only risks his life, but loses it. But just as God used the sinful actions of Saul and the Philistines to fulfill his promises to David, God also used the sinful plans of Pilate and the Pharisees to crown Jesus as King (Acts 2:23). 

God has bigger plans than the circumstances we can see. Our suffering is not in his blindspot, anymore than Jesus’ agony was. God is able to bend the sinfulness of priests, the paranoia of kings, and the violence of a mob to bring about both David’s kingdom and Jesus’ eternal One. And God is most certainly able to bend all things toward good for those who call him King (Romans 8:28). God is entirely in control of life’s drama, and while we might feel hunted now, soon we will rule like David and Jesus (Ephesians 2:6). 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who bends the evil of others to fulfill his promises. And may you see Jesus as the King who bends all things toward good for those who love him."

David is more worthy to rule Israel than king Saul ever was.

David listens to God. He defeats enemy after enemy through patience and prayer. He has unified Israel and brought God’s throne to the center of the nation. He’s built himself a palace and now wants to make a temple for God (2 Samuel 7:2).

But God doesn’t want David to build him a house; God wants to build David a dynasty (2 Samuel 7:5; 11b).

So far there have only been a handful of promises, or covenants, that God has entered into with humans: Noah and the promise to never flood the earth, Abraham and the promise to bless the world through his children, and Moses’ promise that God will be with Israel and give her a home. And in 2 Samuel 7 David receives a new promise and covenant from God. One of David’s sons will establish a kingdom that never ends (2 Samuel 7:13). 

In fact, God will call David’s son his own son (2 Samuel 7:14a). And even when this son of God is disciplined, God’s fatherly love will never abandon him (2 Samuel 7:14b-15). David is floored by this promise of a perpetual kingdom (2 Samuel 7:18). He worships God for his kindness and humbly accepts this covenant (2 Samuel 7:22, 29). 

God’s covenant with David is then proven in a series of military victories. David goes to battle and cuts down every enemy that comes across his sword (2 Samuel 8:1). That’s not because David is a particularly gifted general but because God gave David each of his victories (2 Samuel 8:6, 14). David knows this, and so he dedicates every spoil of war to God (2 Samuel 8:11). 

But there’s another reason David is a worthy king—he keeps his promises. He promised Jonathan, Saul’s son, that once his enemies were defeated he would show kindness to his family (1 Samuel 20:15-16). So he brings Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s crippled son, and sits him at his table as if he were his own (2 Samuel 9:1, 11). 

Where is the Gospel?

The end of 2 Samuel 9 is supposed to show us David at his best. He’s more worthy than Saul. He listens to God. God has promised David’s son will reign forever. David can’t lose in battle, and he keeps his promise to Jonathan. He’s merciful and generous to Saul’s grandson when most ancient kings would have killed this potential threat to the throne.

And in all this David is a picture of Jesus. Jesus is the son God promised to David (Luke 1:32). Jesus isn’t merely willing to eat with the crippled; he heals them (John 5:8). Our enemies threaten us with death, but Jesus defeats every enemy and triumphs over, the weapon, death on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:55). Jesus completes what God promised David in his covenant. He defeats our enemies on every side and is merciful and gracious even to those who are threats to his throne. Jesus is the eternal Son of David and he reigns forever (Revelation 11:15).

An eternal King is good news for us for the same reasons it was good news to David and to Israel. We have a perpetual promise that the humble and weak, like David and like Mephibosheth, will not be crushed by the powerful. Instead, we will sit at God’s table and inherit a Kingdom of peace and power forever (Matthew 5:3-4).  

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who makes promises with his people. And may you see Jesus as your eternal King who has begun his rule and reign of love and justice."

David is about to take Israel’s throne, but it won’t be through political cunning. It will be as he waits on the Lord. 

Israel is divided between those loyal to David in the south and those loyal to Saul in the north (2 Samuel 2:10). Saul’s general Abner cleverly made Saul’s son king in the north before David could broker peace (2 Samuel 2:8-9). Just as Saul’s kingship was marked by political cunning, force, and spy craft, this new Saulide northern kingdom is the same.

But this is the wrong way to become king. Saul learned that lesson with his life—and so will Saul’s son and general. They go to war with David and it’s costly. David’s general Joab loses his brother (2 Samuel 2:23), but David’s forces win profoundly, losing only 20 men to their 360 (2 Samuel 2:30-31). The most important verse in these chapters says that this long war served to make David stronger and stronger, and the Saulide dynasty weaker and weaker (2 Samuel 3:1).

On top of this, there’s political drama inside Saul’s house. Just as Saul was jealous of David’s military brilliance, Saul’s son feels threatened by his general. In an attempt to discredit him, he accuses Abnerof sleeping with one of his father’s wives (2 Samuel 3:7). Saul’s general is deeply insulted (2 Samuel 3:8). He defects to David's side, knowing it spells the end for Saul’s sons (2 Samuel 3:9-10). 

But Saul’s general is immediately murdered by Joab in revenge for killing his brother (2 Samuel 3:27). The author makes sure we know David has nothing to do with this murder (2 Samuel 3:37). And when Saul’s son is finally killed, we understand David is innocent in that death, too. In fact, David executes those who murdered the last member of Saul’s line (2 Samuel 4:12). Most kings would see the death of an enemy heir as politically fortunate and an opportunity to solidify power. But not David. He knows political force is not God’s way of becoming king, so instead he waits.

David’s opponents have chosen warfare, espionage, and politics to save their kingdom, but it’s cost their lives. The only one left to wear the crown is the man who waited for God to save (Psalm 27:14).

Where is the Gospel?

David’ is not like Saul—or any other king for that matter. David’s not domineering or self-congratulatory. He isn’t impatiently taking matters into his own hands. In fact, David is largely silent except when he sings at his fallen comrade’s funeral (2 Samuel 3:33) and demands justice for his enemy’s wrongful deaths (2 Samuel 4:12).

David inherits his kingdom the way Jesus tells us that we will inherit God’s Kingdom. It’s the poor in spirit, the mourners, and the meek who will inherit the earth (Matthew 5:3-5). Those more hungry for mercy than revenge are the people who will be satisfied (Matthew 5:6-7). The peacemakers and the persecuted are the ones who will sit on thrones (Matthew 5:9-10).

It’s easy to get lost in the political intrigue and all the names in this part of Samuel. But David’s rise to power is a picture of how God brings his Kingdom in a complex and competitive world like ours. 

We’re surrounded by rulers and thinkers who lead by force, influence, and personality. We feel like we can’t compete with all the power-brokering, back-door deals and agendas going on around us. But the good news is that all of that is self-destructive. People like Saul will always fall. But if you’re poor, mourning the death of a loved one, or humiliated by your circumstances, then Jesus has good news for you. Just as David rose to his throne and Jesus rose from the dead, the humble will one day rule the world. What we must do is wait. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who sets up kingdoms. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives his Kingdom to those willing to wait for him."

The books of Samuel narrate the rise and fall of King Saul and King David. They chart the end of Israel’s tribal leadership and the beginning of its monarchy. Samuel begins not with political drama, but with a barren womb. In the middle of chaotic and evil Israel, Hannah and her family faithfully make their yearly trip to sacrifice to God at Shiloh (1 Samuel 1:3). 

But Hannah is overwhelmed by both her infertility and the cruelty of her husband’s second wife (1 Samuel 1:7). In tears, Hannah goes to the temple and humbly begs God to remember her and give her a son (1 Samuel 1:10). If God answers her prayer, she promises to dedicate her child for a life of service in God’s temple (1 Samuel 1:11).

But the priest, Eli, mistakes Hannah’s faithful grief for drunkenness (1 Samuel 1:13). It’s a subtle hint that will prove later on that Eli is a bad priest. He can’t tell the difference between humble prayer and drunken muttering (1 Samuel 1:16).

Eli realizes his mistake and asks God to answer her prayers (1 Samuel 1:17). And he does! Just like she prayed, God remembers Hannah and gives her a son—and she names him Samuel (1 Samuel 1:20). And just as she promised, she dedicates Samuel to serve the Lord for the rest of his life (1 Samuel 1:28). 

Hannah then bursts out into song. She rejoices in God’s victory over her dead womb (1 Samuel 2:6). She praises the Lord that her husband’s arrogant wife has been humbled (1 Samuel 2:3, 5b). And Hannah reminds us what the books and birth of Samuel are all about—God’s appointed king (1 Samuel 2:10b). 

Where is the Gospel?

Hannah knew her infertility and the birth of her son were more significant than God’s answer to her prayers; they were also the answers to Israel’s prayers. Like Hannah, Israel was barren. No leader had been born in centuries who was able to bring peace to Israel from her enemies. At the mercy of arrogant judges and disobedient priests, faithful Israel wept for life from the dead and exaltation from their humiliation (1 Samuel 2:8). 

Samuel’s birth marks the end of Israel’s long history of defeat and humiliation. Under Samuel’s leadership, Israel would soon have a prophet to hear God’s voice and a king on the throne. God saved Israel from her pride and destruction through the birth of a weak and humble child. And God would do it again in Jesus.

Like Samuel’s birth to a barren woman signaled the dawning of Israel’s first king, Jesus’ birth to a virgin proclaimed the dawning of Israel’s final King. Like Hannah, Mary sings expectantly that her child is proof that God humiliates the proud but lifts up the humble (Luke 1:52-53). 

Jesus’ faithful mother and humble birth are good news for us in the same way that Samuel’s birth and faithful mother were good news to Israel. 

In Jesus our prayers are answered. God sees our pain, he sees our humiliation, and he has sent his Son to prepare a new Kingdom. And God sent Jesus as a humble baby born in an empty womb to demonstrate that if you are humiliated and dead inside, he is the God who will raise you up and make you alive. In Jesus, our barrenness is over. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who sees your barrenness, and may you see Jesus as God’s sent Son who answers your prayers, raises you up, and humbles your enemies."

He would rather die as God's anointed than celebrate the death of his enemies.,Website,1 & 2 Samuel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Saul is dead and the throne of Israel is empty (1 Samuel 31:6). But David doesn’t know that. He has been busy fighting the Amalekites (1 Samuel 30:1). He doesn’t know that Jonathan was killed and Saul committed suicide (1 Samuel 31:4). David doesn’t find out until three days later when an Amalekite messenger delivers the news (2 Samuel 1:4).

David questions the messenger for details, but the Amalekite lies. He invents a story about mercifully killing Saul himself (2 Samuel 1:9-10), presumably to win David’s favor (2 Samuel 4:10). Even though the Amalekites are enemies, this Amalekite has killed David’s other enemy—Saul. He’s hoping this lie will earn him a place in David’s kingdom as he hands Saul’s crown to David (2 Samuel 1:10). But David doesn’t celebrate like this Amalekite expects. Instead, he cries (2 Samuel 1:11-12). 

God’s anointed king Saul and David’s friend Jonathan are dead. David’s love for Jonathan and his loyalty to Israel as God’s chosen nation overshadows any political ambition. He can’t celebrate his rise to power if it means harm to God’s kingdom. David executes the man who thought he could profit from the death of God’s anointed (2 Samuel 1:15).

David then writes a public poetic eulogy for Saul and Jonathan (2 Samuel 1:17). The refrain cries out three times, “How the mighty have fallen” (2 Samuel 1:25). The song proves David’s genuine grief over Israel’s loss, and his unfailing loyalty to God and the good of his kingdom. 

Only after a national time of mourning does David ask God if it’s time to leave his Philistine headquarters and return to Judah to take the throne (2 Samuel 2:1). God directs him to the southern city of Hebron where he’s officially anointed as the new king of Israel (2 Samuel 2:4). 

His first act as king is to reach out to the northern town Jabesh Gilead. This town had been loyal to Saul from the beginning. It’s where Saul first gathered Israel’s armies (1 Samuel 11:6). David tries to bring together fractured Israel under his leadership. He honors their loyalty to Saul and invites them into a new alliance—a new covenant—with him (2 Samuel 2:6). 

Where is the Gospel?

When Saul rose to power, we saw his cowardice and rebellion. Saul hid from his own coronation (1 Samuel 10:22), and he refused to listen to God (1 Samuel 13:13). That’s why as David rises to power, we’re shown his loyalty to God and his kingdom. He would rather weep over God’s anointed than celebrate the death of his enemy. He would rather reconcile with those most loyal to Saul than cut them out of Israel. David is the right king for Israel!

And Jesus is the right King for us. Like David, he humbly considers God’s Kingdom as more important than giving his enemies what they’re owed (Philippians 2:8). Even while being tortured, he forgives his captors (Luke 23:34). Jesus would rather die as God’s anointed than celebrate the death of his enemies. 

Jesus rises to power not to finally end a vendetta against us, but to invite those loyal to the powers of darkness into a new alliance—a new covenant—bought by his blood (Luke 22:20). Jesus unifies not just northern and southern Israel but the North and South Poles. There is no more Jew or Gentile, Arab or American, Korean or Japanese. All who join his Kingdom are united in Jesus (Colossians 3:11).

Jesus is the unifying and humble King we need, and if you swear loyalty to him, he will faithfully lead you into his Kingdom.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has appointed a King for his people. And may you see Jesus as the King we need to unite our world and lead us into his Kingdom."

Samuel’s prophecy is about to come true. Saul’s kingdom will be ripped from his hands and given to David (1 Samuel 15:28). But David no longer lives in Israel.

Saul’s hunt has forced him to seek safe harbor with the Philistines—the enemies that have plagued Saul since he became king (1 Samuel 13:5). At first, the Philistine overlord Achish believed David was a threat (1 Samuel 21:12). But his prolonged feud with Saul makes him confident he can use David for his own means (1 Samuel 27:12). 

David gladly fights Achish’s battles, but only because they’re Israel’s battles too. Achish wants him to fight the same unconquered nations from the book of Joshua, and the same Amalekites Saul failed to destroy (1 Samuel 15:18-19). David is shrewdly acting like Israel’s king, even in exile and under enemy control.

While David continues to act like a king, Saul devolves into an even more pitiful ruler. God refuses to speak to him (1 Samuel 28:6). Desperate, he seeks help from an outlawed witch and asks her to summon the dead prophet Samuel. And to the witch’s surprise Samuel actually shows up at the seance (1 Samuel 28:12). God uses the witch’s false magic and Saul’s illegal necromancy to confirm his fate as God’s forsaken king. It assures the inevitable rise of David (1 Samuel 28:17). 

The last two chapters of First Samuel then record two battles. David defeats the Amalekites like Saul was supposed to and Saul commits suicide during a battle with the Philistines (1 Samuel 31:4). The conflict between Saul and David is finally over.

Where is the Gospel?

The book of Samuel begins by telling us “the word of the Lord was rare” in Saul’s day (1 Samuel 3:1). And it was Saul’s continued refusal to listen to God’s rare words that earned God’s silence and rejection (1 Samuel 15:10). It’s fitting that Saul’s rebellion against God’s word ends on the doorstep of a necromancer. The prophet Samuel told Saul that his rejection of God’s word would lead him to the dark art of divination (1 Samuel 15:23). Refusing to listen to God didn’t mean Saul didn’t want divine guidance. Samuel knew that rejecting God’s voice just meant Saul would look for a divine voice elsewhere. 

We are not so different from Saul. The voice of the Lord feels rare in our day. But most of us believe that the divine can communicate with us, and we desire that. But by not trusting God’s words, we might look for divine guidance in the occult. Or our guidance is some voice or desire inside of us that we feel we must express and act on. “Following your heart” isn’t all that different from conjuring the dead. Both are choices to listen for transcendent and authoritative guidance outside of God’s words. 

When Saul took this path, he conjured for himself condemnation from the grave (1 Samuel 28:17). But the good news is that while we are desperate for answers from anywhere other than God, his word came to us in Jesus (John 1:14a). Just as David faithfully listened to the Lord and won the battles Saul lost (1 Samuel 30:8, 17), Jesus faithfully listened to God (John 5:30). And on the cross, God’s Word did battle with God’s silence and won (Mark 15:34). The empty tomb speaks words of transcendent and authoritative victory to everyone who listens to God’s Word and his good news. Divine life and guidance isn’t found in tea leaves or divination but in hearing God’s words and keeping them (Luke 11:28). In Saul’s day the dead prophet Samuel came back to preach doom. But today God speaks through our once dead but now living prophet Jesus—and he preaches eternal life (Hebrews 1:2).  

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is not silent. And may you see Jesus as our living prophet whose empty tomb speaks life to all who listen."

Jesus takes the throne, even when it means being crowned with thorns.",Website,1 & 2 Samuel Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Israel does not want God to be their King anymore (1 Samuel 8:7). They want to do away with God’s system of tribal leadership and become more like the monarchies they see around them (1 Samuel 8:5). 

Samuel warns that the rules of foreign kings are marked by “taking” and “serving,” and Israel’s king will be the same. He’ll take what he wants, and once it’s all gone he’ll enslave them to get more (1 Samuel 8:17-18). 

Regardless, Israel demands a king. And God gives one to them in Saul (1 Samuel 9:19, 22).  Despite his objections, Samuel appoints him as the new ruler of Israel (1 Samuel 9:16, 21). Samuel then gives Saul three prophecies that will confirm him as God’s elected king, the most significant of which is the coming of God’s Spirit. The Spirit transforms Saul not only into someone who can lead Israel, but into a prophet as well (1 Samuel 10:6-7).

Samuel then publicly confirms Saul’s kingship by casting lots (1 Samuel 10:20). By God’s control of these objects of chance, Saul is chosen as king. But Saul hides from his coronation (1 Samuel 10:21-22). Like Israel, he doesn’t want to acknowledge God’s call to be distinct from the people around him.

But immediately Saul is given the chance to prove his worth as a king when the Israelite town of Jabesh Gilead comes under siege. The Spirit overwhelms Saul and he saves the town (1 Samuel 11:11). Proven by both chance and battle, Saul is officially made king (1 Samuel 11:15).

Samuel then marks the transition of power from himself to Saul in a speech (1 Samuel 12:2). He reminds Israel that he has never “taken” anything from them nor made anyone “serve” him during his leadership (1 Samuel 12:3). He recounts the ways God was faithful to them despite their unfaithfulness in requesting a king (1 Samuel 12:12). And he demonstrates God’s displeasure by sending a storm in the middle of their harvest (1 Samuel 12:17).

Samuel will no longer lead Israel, but he promises to pray and to teach them how to be faithful to God (1 Samuel 12:23). He warns that failing to do so will mean both Israel and her king will be swept away (1 Samuel 12:25). 

Where is the Gospel?

Israel’s desire for a king isn’t just a change in political organization, but a rejection of God’s right to rule Israel. It’s spiritual treason because Israel is ultimately God’s Kingdom.  

So God gives them the leader they deserve—a king who over the course of his life will reject God as the true leader of Israel. That’s foreshadowed as he hides at his coronation, rejecting and refusing to acknowledge God’s choice of him as Israel’s leader (1 Samuel 10:21-22).

The victories and prophecies Saul performs don’t reveal God’s approval of Saul, so much as his mercy towards his people. Even in their rejection of God as their King, God still graciously acts like one. He defeats their enemies through the leader they wrongly desired. 

Like Israel, we want to place our own “kings” on the throne and be ruled by voices other than God’s. And just as God allowed Saul to rule Israel, the apostle Paul tells us that God will give us the leaders and lives we deserve (Romans 1:24a). These “kings” will take and take until we’re finally enslaved by them.

But even in our rejection of God as King, God still acts like one. Jesus takes the throne, even when it means being crowned with thorns. Just like Saul’s coronation, Jesus’ cross is both our rejection of God as King, and the moment we are rescued from our enemies. Jesus nails our enemies’ heads to the cross and proves himself as a worthy King, more powerful than even death. 

And Jesus, rather than taking from and enslaving, promises to serve and set free even traitors like us (Matthew 20:28). So don’t be like Israel. Admit your rebellion, accept God’s chosen leader Jesus, bow to the True King, and you live forever in his Kingdom of peace. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is King. And may you see Jesus as the King who doesn’t take or demand to be served, but serves by offering his life and Kingdom to us."

Jesus gives us more than we need.",Website,Ruth Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Ruth and Naomi have just discovered that Boaz is one of their family’s “redeemers.” In Israel, a “redeemer” has a social and legal responsibility to care for poor relatives, particularly widows. In her current status, Naomi will have to sell her family’s land to survive. But if Boaz marries Ruth, their problems will be solved! Through Boaz, an end to their emptiness seems like it might come true. But Ruth is also a widow as well as poor, infertile, and a foreigner. It’s not clear that Boaz will even entertain Ruth as a possible partner.

So Naomi comes up with a clever but risky plan to secure a marriage proposal from Boaz (Ruth 3:1). Ruth needs to get dressed up, put on expensive perfume, and then wait for Boaz to fall asleep after a big meal (Ruth 3:3). She should then uncover his feet and lie down next to him (Ruth 3:4). 

This plan is clever because Naomi waits until Boaz is full and happy. Uncovering his feet means that at some point in the night, Boaz will wake up from the cold and—surprise—see beautiful Ruth humbly lying at his feet. But this plan flirts on the edge of inappropriate: a man and a woman alone at night, sleeping together and hidden from view. Ruth even “uncovers” him. The sexual tension is as thick as the consequences if Boaz takes this plan the wrong way. But Ruth agrees to do what Naomi suggests (Ruth 3:5).

But, Ruth goes off-script. When Boaz wakes up and sees her, Ruth does not wait for his response. Instead, Ruth proposes not only marriage but redemption for Naomi and her legacy (Ruth 3:9). Ruth calls Boaz a “redeemer.” She wants Boaz’s hand in marriage, not so much for her benefit but Naomi’s. Naomi’s family line will end without Boaz’s help. But if Boaz marries her, Ruth’s child will become Naomi’s heir, and Naomi’s land will remain in her family. 

Boaz is overwhelmed by Ruth’s loyalty to Naomi. Not only has she left her homeland for her, she’s also willing to leverage her marriage for Naomi’s good and happiness rather than her own (Ruth 3:10).

Boaz wants to say yes, but there is a problem. There is another redeemer who needs the opportunity to weigh in (Ruth 3:12). 

Where is the Gospel?

Throughout Ruth and Naomi’s story, there’s an important Hebrew word that’s crucial to understand. It’s probably translated as “kindness” in your Bible. 

We’re told Ruth showed Naomi kindness by leaving her homeland (Ruth 1:8). Boaz showed Ruth kindness by lavishly giving food to her and Naomi. Boaz calls Ruth’s marriage proposal an act of kindness too (Ruth 3:10). Kindness in Ruth doesn’t just mean being nice, but being loyal. And beyond being loyal, it means sacrificial loyalty. It costs Ruth a lot to leave her homeland. Ruth’s proposal to Boaz means she’s giving up marrying for love or money. And as we will see in the next chapter, accepting this marriage proposal costs Boaz financially—not to mention whatever social cost that might come from marrying an infertile outsider. 

The first time this type of kindness is mentioned in the Bible is when God describes himself to Israel on Mt. Sinai (Exodus 20:6, 34:6-7). God says he is loyal and steadfastly kind. He will love Israel no matter the cost to himself. In Ruth and Boaz, we see a living picture of God’s kindness, but we also see a living picture of Jesus’ love toward us.

Out of loyalty to God’s promises of steadfast kindness, Jesus left his homeland and married a bride at great cost to himself (Ephesians 5:25). And just like Ruth didn’t propose to Boaz because he was handsome or rich, Jesus did not join himself with us because we’re the best or brightest. Jesus died for us because he is kind and loyal. He’s kind toward people in need and loyal to the promises he made. 

So do you need kindness from God? Do you want the Lord’s sacrificial mercy to meet your needs? Then be like Ruth. Lie at his feet and propose. Boldly tell him what’s on the line if he doesn’t act—and be confident in the God who is more kind than Boaz and will give you all you need.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who covers us with his wings. And may you see Jesus’ loyal kindness as he emptied himself so that we can become full.

Ruth has pledged loyalty to widowed and childless Naomi. In some ways, this means Ruth must act like a son or a husband. She’s taken on the responsibility to care for her mother-in-law, and right now, they’re both starving. So Ruth, knowing her new homeland’s history, takes advantage of a law in the Old Testament which allowed the poor to gather leftovers from fields during harvest time (Leviticus 19:9-10). And seemingly by chance, Ruth ends up in a field that belongs to a man named Boaz (Ruth 2:3). 

Boaz learns about Ruth’s situation and that she has been working hard since sunrise. He also hears that she asked to not only glean from the leftovers (which is what the law explicitly says) but also between the piles of grain stacked by his workers (Ruth 2:7). This is beyond what the law requires but, Ruth’s faithfulness to Naomi and her courageous request for special treatment compels Boaz to respond with extreme generosity (Ruth 2:15). He invites her to lunch and instructs his servants to allow Ruth to take whatever she wants (Ruth 2:14). Ruth ends her day’s work with nearly a month’s worth of food (Ruth 2:17).

Naomi is shocked by Boaz’s kindness and realizes that Boaz is actually a relative of her late husband and a “redeemer” (Ruth 2:20). In Israel, this is a technical term. A family’s “redeemer” has a social and legal responsibility to care for poor relatives who are at risk of losing their land or inheritance, particularly if they have lost their husband.

Not only have Naomi and Ruth’s immediate needs been met by a generous man, but Boaz is also single. In Boaz, there’s hope that what Naomi and Ruth lost in their husbands and sons will be restored. 

Where is the Gospel?

Naomi and Ruth’s fortunes begin to turn when Ruth is bold, courageous, and hard-working. Boaz calls Ruth a “worthy woman” because of the way she follows God’s laws and cares for Naomi (Ruth 3:11).

Traditionally, the book of Ruth was placed right after Proverbs 31, which describes a wise and “worthy” woman (Proverbs 31:10). That placement invites us to see Ruth as wisdom in the flesh. Like the Proverbs 31 woman, she wakes up early and works hard (Proverbs 31:15, 17). She provides for the needy and fears the Lord (Proverbs 31:20, 30). 

When Ruth is wise and faithful, a redeemer generously provides. That’s the message of the Book of Proverbs too. When we fear God and live wisely, the Lord will reward and save us (Proverbs 11:30). 

And like Ruth, Jesus is also wisdom in the flesh (Colossians 2:3). Just as Ruth’s wisdom was clearly seen in her sacrificial loyalty to Naomi, the Apostle Paul tells us that Jesus’ wisdom is most clearly seen in his sacrificial death (1 Corinthians 1:23-24). Jesus wisely went to the cross for us, like Ruth went to the fields for Naomi. 

And as Boaz gave Ruth a kindness that went beyond the letter of the law, Jesus gives us a kindness that goes beyond the law as well. The law said Ruth was allowed scraps from the edge of the field, not a feast in the middle of it. Likewise, the law says sinners like us deserve punishment and death, not a feast at God’s table. 

Yet Jesus wisely gives us far more than the law says we deserve. And all we need to do to receive that type of kindness is wisely ask for it just as Ruth did. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who provides. And may you see Jesus as the one who faithfully, wisely, and sacrificially makes us his family."

He is a redeemer who rules a God's Kingdom and provides for his people.",Website,Ruth Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Naomi’s land, legacy, and livelihood all rest on Boaz. He is her potential redeemer, and Ruth has just proposed to him. A redeemer is someone who takes responsibility for the legal, familial, and financial responsibilities of their poorer relatives, especially widows.

Boaz agrees to marry Ruth, but there’s a problem. Boaz can’t act as Naomi’s redeemer because a more closely related redeemer must first be given the chance (Ruth 3:12). 

Boaz doesn’t waste any time. The morning after the proposal he waits at the town gate until he spots the potential redeemer (Ruth 4:1). Without mentioning Ruth, Boaz explains to the unnamed redeemer that Naomi has put her husband’s land up for sale and he has the right of first refusal (Ruth 4:3).

Thinking this is a low-risk, high-reward investment, he immediately says “yes” (Ruth 4:4). But then the potential redeemer finds out that purchasing the land also includes the responsibility to care for widowed Naomi and Ruth. So he refuses. To purchase the land is one thing, but to marry Ruth and possibly split his inheritance and lose that land to any of Ruth’s future children is too great of a risk (Ruth 4:6).

So Boaz does what this man won’t (Ruth 4:9). He accepts the risks to his inheritance and shoulders the responsibility of continuing Naomi’s legacy and land (Ruth 4:10). 

Everyone watching realizes that widowed, childless, and foreign-born Ruth, along with widowed Naomi, have been provided for in an extraordinary way. They pray that God will make Moabite Ruth like the founding mothers of Israel—Rachel, Leah, and Tamar (Ruth 4:11). Then God answers their prayers by miraculously giving Ruth a son named Obed, after ten years of infertility (Ruth 4:13).

The town erupts in celebration. Now Naomi has not only a redeemer in Boaz but also in this new baby (Ruth 4:14). When Obed grows up, he will take care of her and ensure that Naomi’s legacy will never die (Ruth 4:15). 

Where is the Gospel?

The book begins by reminding us that Ruth lived during the “days when the judges ruled” and there was no king in Israel (Ruth 1:1). But the book ends with a royal genealogy. Obed is the grandfather of King David (Ruth 4:22).

That means Ruth was not simply kind. Boaz was not just sacrificial. Naomi’s emptiness wasn’t merely filled. These characters show us how God plans to redeem his people. Through Boaz and Ruth’s sacrificial kindness, God provided a redeemer to both Naomi and Israel. 

Obed would one day father King David, who would one day take the throne. David would take responsibility for Israel’s legacy and land, like his great-grandfather Boaz took responsibility for Naomi’s legacy and land. And just like the miraculous birth of Obed secured the continuation of Naomi’s line, God miraculously tells David that his line will continue forever (2 Samuel 7:16). God promises the great-grandson of Ruth that a son of David will rule eternally.

The author of Matthew’s Gospel tells us that Ruth and Boaz aren’t just David’s ancestors, they are Jesus’ too (Matthew 1:5). Jesus is the descendant of Boaz and David. Like his forefathers, Jesus’ sacrificial kindness will redeem his family from their destitution. On the cross, Jesus becomes our final redeemer. He takes responsibility for both our physical and spiritual destitution so that we will never be without land, legacy, or livelihood (Luke 4:18). 

Just as God promised David, Jesus lives and reigns resurrected forever. Like Ruth and Naomi, we can come to him with our emptiness. We can ask him to redeem us. We can ask Jesus to take responsibility for our sin and our hopelessness and do something to fix it. And the good news of the Book of Ruth is that Jesus will rescue us like both a close relative and a powerful King!

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who does not leave his people without a Redeemer. And may you see Jesus as our sacrificially kind Savior who dies to redeem us all."

Ruth makes us hope for a king who can bring fullness out of emptiness. 

Before Ruth’s story begins, we’re told Israel is in the time of the judges (Ruth 1:1). It’s perhaps the darkest of Israel’s eras, marked by its cruelty toward women and a profound lack of godly leadership (Judges 19:25). Ruth and Naomi, the main characters, stand out as faithful women among a generation of faithless men. But like the rest of Israel, their lives are full of tragedy and death. Israel is in the middle of a famine. Naomi’s husband and her two sons are dead (Ruth 1:3, 5). Naomi doesn’t even live in Israel anymore; she’s marooned in Moab, an old enemy nation of Israel. Her only companions are her sons’ infertile widows, Ruth and Orpah. 

Naomi’s situation seems hopeless. In this culture, the only hope for these three widowed women is to either have a son or to marry a rich man. Neither option seems possible for these foreign, infertile, and aged women. 

Naomi realizes her only hope is to move from Moab and return to her hometown of Bethlehem (Ruth 1:7). Naomi discourages Ruth and Orpah from joining her (Ruth 1:8). As Moabite women, they are almost guaranteed a life as a disliked minority in Israel (Ruth 1:12). So Orpah returns home, but Ruth shows loyalty to Naomi (Ruth 1:15). Instead of leaving, Ruth declares that Naomi’s God is her God, and Naomi’s people are her people (Ruth 1:16). She would rather die than leave Naomi (Ruth 1:17). 

So they leave together. Naomi and Ruth, barren and hungry, arrive in Bethlehem. But as a hint to what God is about to do for them and Israel, the barley harvest has just begun (Ruth 1:22). Soon their emptiness will be filled, and a king will be born.

Where is the Gospel?

Early in Israel’s history, the founding mothers of Israel—Sarah, Rebekah, and Rachel—were all unable to have children. But God miraculously opened their wombs and provided a new leader for his people. We expect that story to be repeated here, but unlike those stories, there’s no man to help provide the child. Ruth is alone, an infertile and foreign daughter-in-law. But Ruth’s willingness to sacrifice her own life to serve her mother-in-law will be how God provides Israel a new king, and we’ll talk about that in Ruth 4. 

Like many women in Israel's history, Mary should not have been able to have a child. She was a virgin (Luke 1:34). But Mary’s willingness to serve the Lord means that through her, a King will be born who will bless the world through his Kingdom (Luke 1:31, 34, 38). Jesus is the son of Ruth and Mary’s faithfulness. Jesus will even be born in Noami’s hometown of Bethlehem! He is the true King, not just of Israel, but of the world. He was born to fill our emptiness through his reign as King (Luke 4:18).

So if you’re barren like Ruth, if you’re widowed like Naomi, if you’re leaderless like Israel, if you’re hungry, if you’re poor, or if it seems scientifically impossible for you to be filled, the book of Ruth is for you. A child has been born and his name is Jesus. If like Ruth, you loyally pledge yourself to King Jesus, everything you need will be provided (Matthew 6:33). 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is King. And may you see Jesus as a loyal friend who will fill your emptiness."

Numbers 7-10:10 is a flashback to the end of Exodus when Moses finished constructing the tabernacle. 

What makes the first part of this text beautiful is also what makes it monotonous and difficult to read. All the tribes come to the tabernacle and make the same offering. And the entire contents of that offering are detailed all 12 times (7:78-83). Why go into such long detail? 

Well, each tribe is obeying the sacrifices outlined back in Leviticus. And this long list shows us that the people are obeying down to the finest detail. 

Unlike the end of Exodus, at the end of this long 12-day festival of obedience, Moses is able to enter into the tabernacle and talk with God (7:89). 

After this, the Levites make their grain and sin offerings like the rest of Israel, but then the whole nation gathers together. All the people of Israel put their hands on the Levites and then the Levites are called an offering to the Lord (8:10-11). But the Levites aren’t sacrificed. They must go on living so they can serve at the tabernacle (8:19). 

But there is still a sacrifice. As Israel lays their hands on the Levites, the Levites lay their hands on the heads of bulls (8:12). Sin and guilt transfer from the people, through the Levites, onto the sacrifice. This is a grand picture of what would happen again and again at the tabernacle. 

Where is the Gospel? 

But it is also a picture of something even grander. This is a picture of how we can approach God through Jesus. When we put our faith in Jesus we, in effect, lay our hands on him. Just as Israel did with the Levites and the bulls, we put our sin and guilt on Jesus (Is 53:6). 

And just as every tribe brought the exact right offering, Jesus’ body and blood was the exact right offering for everyone in the world who believes in him (Heb 10:14). 

Surely this is the image Paul had in mind when he wrote that Christians are “living sacrifices” (Rom. 12:1). Christians are a living offering to God like the Levites. 

Like the Levites, we stand between God’s presence and the whole world. God has put his hand on us and called us to take the good news of Jesus to those around us (2 Cor 5:20). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who is so perfect, holy, and powerful that such great provision must be taken to draw near to him. And that you would see Jesus as that great provision that perfectly draws us near."

Numbers isn’t about Numbers. It is a story. It is the story of Israel traveling through the wilderness to get to the Promised Land. 

One of the most important things we need to constantly remind ourselves of in this passage and throughout the book of Numbers is brought up in the very first verse. God spoke to Moses in the tent (1:1). 

And the first thing he tells Moses to do is to take a census - to count the people (1:2). But he isn’t instructed to count all the people, only men over the age of 20. The reason for this is because Israel is about to set out toward the land God promised them. But it is an inhabited land. God is preparing these men over 20 for war. 

When the counting is done, we find out that there are over 600,000 men of fighting age (1:45-46). That means that there must be over 2 million people in the entire camp of Israel. That’s an enormous amount of people. But it is a sign of God’s promise. 

Back in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, God promised Abraham that he would turn his descendants into such a great nation that their numbers couldn’t be counted (Gen 15:5). But by the end of Genesis, as they were headed down to Egypt, Abraham’s descendants totaled 70 in all - not quite an uncountable number (Ex 1:5). 

However, their numbers jumped from 70 to 2 million in a few hundred years. How is that possible? The answer to that question is the point being made by this long list of numbers and names. God’s faithfulness, involvement, and miracle-working power are being demonstrated in cold hard data. He has been true to his promises. He has made Israel into a great nation. 

But this is not the end of God’s promise. How do we know this? The number is countable. The promise was that God would make an uncountable number of descendants out of Abraham (Gen 22:17). Therefore, these 600,000 are a downpayment on God’s final and full promise. 

Where is the Gospel?

 

Where is the promise finally and fully completed? In Jesus. The New Testament tells us that all who believe in Jesus are sons and daughters of Abraham (Gal 3:7). By sending his son to us, God adopted us into his family, at the price of Jesus’ life (Gal 4:4-5). How many Christians are there in the world today? How many have there been throughout all time? The number is uncountable, except by God. 

And now, this uncountable nation of Christians around the world are filled with the spirit of God as Israel had in the tabernacle (1 Cor 3:16). We march not to a physical war, but to a spiritual war (Eph 6:12). We are not engaged in this war to reclaim a piece of land on this earth, but to invite everyone who will hear into the true Promise Land - the new heavens and new earth in which we will dwell with God forever (2 Cor 10:5).

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will give you eyes to see the God who keeps his promises, and that you will see Jesus as the one who took the downpayment of descendants we read about in Numbers and turns it into the uncountable sum of Christians God has saved throughout all generations."

In most English literature, the climax of a story comes near the end. But in Hebrew literature, which is what the Old Testament is, the main point often comes in the middle.

That middle point of Leviticus is the Day of Atonement. And since Leviticus is the middle book of the Torah, this chapter is the middle of the middle. 

The Day of Atonement is so important because that is the day a human got to go into God’s presence in the Holy of Holies (Leviticus 16:2-3). This is the center of the tabernacle, behind the innermost veil, where God’s actual presence was.

There are two main sacrifices made on this day. The first is a bull for the priest’s sins and the cleansing of the tabernacle (Leviticus 16:6). Its blood is brought into the Holy of Holies behind the veil and put on the mercy seat which is like God’s kingly footstool (Leviticus 16:14). 

The second sacrifice involves two goats (Leviticus 16:7). One goat is a sin offering for all the people. Its blood is also brought into the Holy of Holies to cleanse it on behalf of all the people's sins (Leviticus 16:15). 

The second goat, was brought in front of the tent where the high priest would lay his hands on it, and confess all the sins of the people (Leviticus 16:21). The goat was then taken outside the city and released into the wilderness, never to return (Leviticus 16:22). The picture is a powerful one for the people of Israel. Their sin has literally been taken away from them. 

Where is the Gospel? 

As Christians, we have an even better Day of Atonement because Jesus is our new high priest. 

What the High Priest had to do every year, Jesus was able to do once for all (Romans 6:10). Now, we only need one Day of Atonement - the day Jesus died on the cross. 

The Day of Atonement brought one priest behind that curtain once a year. But after Jesus died on the cross, the curtain in the temple was torn in two (Matthew 27:51). Jesus’ sacrifice gives eternal access to all who believe. 

Israel had to be constantly reminded of their never-ending problem of sin by this and other rituals. But because Jesus has offered the last and final sacrifice, we can be sure that our sin has been dealt with permanently. That is why we no longer have to practice any sacrifices (Hebrews 9:12). It is finished! 

So why is this in the middle of Leviticus and the middle of the Torah? Because one of the Bible’s main points is God’s desire to live with his people. And the Day of Atonement shows us how he makes this possible. It also tells us that, in Jesus, the cross now sits at the center of everything we do. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who makes a way to dwell with us and forgive us. And that he does this finally and fully through Jesus dying for us on the cross - our once-for-all Day of Atonement."

A crescendo has been building in the book of Numbers between the promised death of the old generation and the promised inheritance for the younger. 

And now, here in this passage, we get a changing of the guard, a passage from the old generation to the new. 

In the first episode of this changing of the guard, Israel has intermarried with other nations and are worshipping their false god (25:3). Like elsewhere in Numbers, a plague from God breaks out and starts claiming lives. 

Instead of older Moses, Aaron’s grandson Phinehas takes the responsibility on himself. He puts the guilty parties to death and the plague ends (25:8). But before it does, it claims the last of the old generation. God’s promise that they would all perish in the wilderness has come true.

What follows mirrors the opening of the book. Another census is made, this time of the younger generation who has grown up in the wilderness. The task of entering the Promised Land and driving out the inhabitants has fallen to them. 

The promise to this new generation is so strong, in fact, that God uses the census to divvy up the land before they enter it (26:52). God is basically instructing them to count their chickens before they’re hatched. 

The final scene in this changing of the guard is Moses deputizing Joshua as his successor (27:18). Joshua, not Moses, would take the people into the Promised Land. 

But Joshua wasn’t the ultimate solution for Israel or the world. Over and over again throughout the Bible, a new leader will have to be brought up because of the failures of the old leader. A new generation will take the promises of God upon themselves that the former generation was unable to realize. 

Where is the Gospel? 

This cycle does not end until Jesus is brought up as the new and final leader. He was not deputized by man, but by God (Mat 3:17). Like Phinehas, he put an end to the plague of death that stood against us because of our disobedience (2 Tim 1:10). But unlike Phinehas, he did not accomplish this by putting the guilty to death. Instead, he allowed himself to be put to death to turn back the punishment we deserved. 

And since he did this, we have the surest and confirmed promise that could ever be made. Everyone who puts their trust in Jesus will be a part of the generation that enters into the new and final Promised Land - the new heavens and new earth where we will dwell with God forever (Rev 21:3). 

In fact, we can start counting our chickens before they’re hatched. Jesus told us that he has gone ahead of us to prepare a place for us to live together (John 14:3). He’s marked off the boundaries, secured our plot, and will surely bring us there to himself. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who is faithful to generation after generation despite our constant rebellion. And that you would see Jesus as the ultimate faithful one who has made a way for the final generation of all believers to enter into his presence once and for all.

The people of Israel have come to Mt. Sinai, just as God promised Moses they would. 

And once they get there, God shows up! His presence is like a cloud, with thunder and lightning (Exodus 19:16). 

But the point of God showing up is to start a relationship with his people through a covenant. A covenant is simply an agreement between two parties - like a contract. 

The agreement is pretty straight forward: If the people obey God’s commands they will be his treasured possession (Exodus 19:5). They will live with God and be his people forever. 

Moses alone is allowed to go up the mountain, where God gives the first of his commands. These are famously known as the Ten Commandments, and they act as a synopsis of the rest of the laws. 

The entire basis of these commands is that God has saved this people from slavery before he commanded them to do anything (Exodus 20:2). God’s saving work was not based on their obedience.

The commands also give us a glimpse into God’s character. Israel must keep the Sabbath, because God desires rest and peace for his people (Exodus 20:8). They must not murder because God saves the lives of his people (Exodus 20:13). They must not commit adultery because God is faithful to his people (Exodus 20:14). On and on, we can see who God is by how he calls Israel to live. 

Where Is the Gospel? 

But as we know, both Israel and the rest of humanity broke these ten simple and good laws over and over again (James 2:10). We did not hold up our side of the covenant. So we do not have the right to live with God or be his people. 

Nevertheless, Jesus came down to earth like God came down to Sinai. But this time, we don’t climb up the mountain to God’s glory. God’s glory comes off the mountain to us. 

Jesus did this, not only by coming in the flesh, but by upholding our end of the covenant. Jesus obeyed every one of God’s commands and credits his obedience to those who believe in him (Romans 8:4). Now, we get to receive the promise attached to the covenant - God is our God and we are his people. 

What makes this news even better is that God saves us in the same order in which he saved Israel. Jesus saves us before we ever obeyed him. 

Instead, the good news of what Jesus has done for us move us to obey him (John 14:15). We obey him out of love, because we want to. 

Finally, we can also see the character of Jesus in these commands. Jesus is everything the law required. Jesus is completely truthful, faithful, and life-giving. 

And now, he is actually making us like him through the Holy Spirit within us (2 Corinthians 3:18). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who saves before he commands. And Jesus as the one who obeys the commands so we can be saved."

Here the book of Exodus closes with the culmination, at least in part, of everything God has been doing throughout this book. 

The plan God gave Moses for the tabernacle, priestly garments, and everything that goes along with them is now being brought into reality. Everything God commanded Moses to build while he was on the mountain, the people obediently build in the camp. 

Israel is finally obeying the voice of God. But what changed between the episode with the golden calf and now? 

The difference is that God’s Spirit is at work. God’s Spirit equips everyone from the craftsmen to the donors to accomplish what God has commanded (Exodus 35:31). The Spirit fills artisans create and those with resources to be generous. The people are obeying God’s voice by the work of God’s Spirit. 

The last thing we see in Exodus is both spectacular and disheartening. 

After the tabernacle is built, God comes and fills it with his presence (Exodus 40:34). God is now with his people.  Unfortunately, the last thing we hear from the book of Exodus is that not even Moses is able to enter into the tabernacle (Exodus 40:35). The presence of God, as we have seen time and time again, is too holy, too glorious, too powerful. 

So we are left with a problem. How can people dwell within the presence of God? This is the question left dangling in our minds which propels us to keep reading. Because in the next book, Leviticus, we get our answer. God’s people will be able to enter his presence through the sacrificial system. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Without the Spirit of God, we would always and only disobey God and grumble against him. Only when the Holy Spirit comes and works in our hearts to cause us to follow after him, can we ever do anything right (Ezekiel 36:27). 

This is what Jesus accomplished for us. He sent the Holy Spirit to us to give us new hearts that could obey (Romans 2:29). The Holy Spirit works a miraculous change in everyone who belongs to Jesus. 

But how are we a fit place for God’s Spirit to live? If so much effort was taken to carefully build the tabernacle in the exact right way, how are any of us an appropriate residence for God’s Spirit?

Surely, it can’t be because of any of our merits. Moses himself couldn’t enter this special dwelling yet. The only way any of us can be a place that God’s Spirit can live and work is if we are cleaned up and made holy. That’s what Jesus does. 

Jesus cleanses us like the tabernacle was cleansed by perfume, incense, and sacrificial blood. He doesn’t just clean us up just enough to make us acceptable (1 John 1:7). He makes us so holy that we become God’s new dwelling place. 

See for Yourself

I pray the Holy Spirit gives you eyes to see the God who works among his people to help them prepare a place for his dwelling. And Jesus as the one who accomplished everything in us to make our very bodies a fit place for him to live."

These two chapters tie up the last bit of detail concerning the tabernacle and the priests.

First, there is the altar of incense, which stands right outside the Holy of Holies (Exodus 30:1). The incense burns around the clock, all day everyday, as a constant reminder of God’s presence. 

Next, all the people are counted. Each person is required to pay a price to atone for their sins (Exodus 30:12). This money funds the priests and their work, because it is the priests who make atonement for the people. 

After the census, plans are given for a bronze basin (Exodus 30:18). In the outer court, before making sacrifices at the altar, the priests would have to wash in this basin in order to be made ritually clean. 

Finally, details are given for a special anointing oil, or perfume (Exodus 30:22). This oil was to be spread on all the different parts and instruments of the tabernacle to make them holy. 

Where is the Gospel? 

It truly is amazing how God set up this whole system to show us more about himself, and ultimate to show us more about Jesus. 

We can see Jesus in the altar of incense. The true and final pleasing aroma before the Lord is Jesus’ sacrificial death (Ephesians 5:2). Unlike the tabernacle’s smoke, Jesus is not the symbol of God’s presence, but God’s presence itself. Only by entering through the fragrant aroma of Christ’s work for us on the cross can we be allowed into the presence of God. 

Christians carry the aroma of Christ with us everywhere we go (2 Corinthians 2:16). We take God’s presence out of the tabernacle and fill the world with it. 

We can also see Jesus in the atonement price paid for each member of the Israelite congregation (1 Timothy 2:6). This time, if we took a census of everyone in the world who needed their sins paid for it would total the earth’s entire population. 

But, for those of us who have Jesus as our high priest, we can come to Christ without price (Revelation 21:6). Jesus’ work isn’t started, supported, or sustained by our contributions. He pays it all and gives it freely to us out of his grace. 

Jesus also fulfills the bronze washing basin. He is the living water in which we wash and are made white as snow (Ephesians 5:26). We don’t wash ourselves and then come and make a sacrifice at the altar. He puts himself on the altar and meets us at the basin to cleanse us. 

Jesus is also like the tabernacle’s perfume. We are God’s temple (1 Corinthians 3:16). Like the anointing oil, the Holy Spirit enters the people of God, making each part of us holy.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who goes to such great lengths to provide a way for his people to dwell with him, and Jesus as the one who accomplishes every little detail to make that possible."

God’s people are slaves in Egypt when they cry out to God for help. And God answers their cries (Exodus 2:24). 

His answer comes by saving a Hebrew baby from certain death, raising him to power in Egypt, and then bringing him out of Egypt so that God might put a powerful call on his life. That man is named Moses. 

While tending sheep, God appears to Moses and starts speaking out of a burning bush (Exodus 3:2). 

The voice identifies itself as the God of Moses’ forefathers - Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He tells Moses that he is going to rescue his people from their oppression in Egypt and that he is going to use Moses to do it. 

Moses has a lot of questions, but his most important has to do with God’s name. Moses asks what he is supposed to call this God (Exodus 3:13). 

God’s answer is,“I Am.” In the context of this passage, that name means at least two things. 

First, it reminds us of all the times God says “I Am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” in this conversation (Exodus 3:6). He is the same God who spoke to Abraham and promised to make him a great nation.

God also used this name when he said, “I am with you” to Moses. God is going to make good on his promises to Abraham by accomplishing them with his very presence. 

Where is the Gospel?

The good news found in God’s name goes even further. For the whole world, ourselves included, have been in Israel’s position; crying out for God to save us from our slave masters of death and sin. 

And what happens when God hears the cries of the oppressed? He shows up!

Jesus was with us in flesh and blood (John 1:14). Jesus was with us in the humble form of a human. The Great I Am came to us. 

Which is why the ultimate expression of God’s name - I Am - is found in Jesus. 

Not only is Jesus the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he is their promised descendent who would accomplish all the promises made to them. Jesus is both the promise maker and the promise keeper. He who made the promise to Eve and all her children became one of Eve’s children to keep that promise. 

And the ultimate saving miracle he performed was not a sign or wonder external to himself, though he did perform those. The ultimate miracle he performed was his death and resurrection. That’s how he is with us! That’s how he keeps his promises! That’s how he saves us! Through his death and resurrection Jesus can say I am with you to keep my promises. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that his Spirit gives you eyes to see the nearness of the God who is with us to keep his promises, and Jesus as the true embodiment of the I Am, who came even nearer in flesh and blood to complete every promise he made."

The greatest miracle of all is how the resurrected Christ softens our hearts to make us believe.",Website,Exodus Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

God has promised that he will still deliver his people from Egypt through great acts of judgement. 

These are the plagues - a series of mighty, miraculous acts that devastate the Egyptian economy, infrastructure, leadership, and people (Exodus 7:4). 

The plagues are not only a direct punishment against Egyptian evil, but a statement against Egypt’s false gods. Egypt had many gods that supposedly had power of different parts of their world: the river, the sun, the crops, the livestock, and more. 

So whenever God would turn the river to blood or the sun to darkness, whenever he would cut down crops with locust or devastate livestock with disease, he was showing all people that there is no one greater than Israel’s God (Exodus 7:5). 

But throughout all these miraculous judgments, Pharaoh doesn’t budge. 

He keeps refusing to see God as the power behind these plagues. He rationalizes, barters, and lies, but never repents and lets Israel go (Exodus 9:7b). 

Why? We are told it is because his heart is hard. No matter how much of God’s glory and might he saw in the plagues, his heart remained unchanged (Exodus 7:3-4). 

Where is the Gospel? 

This is our story as well. No matter how many times God reveals his glory, justice, and power to the world, we are still hardened in heart, and tend toward disbelief and disobedience.

In the Gospel of Jesus, God overpowers every false god, every man made religion, and every political infrastructure that would try to claim a power or truth apart from him. 

He has rid the demonic kingdom of its power to condemn by dying on the cross for our sins (Colossians 2:15). He has authenticated faith in him as the one true religion by rising from the dead (Acts 17:31). And he has proven himself as more powerful than every worldly regime by ascending to heaven and sitting on the highest throne (Ephesians 1:20). 

The mighty sign of Jesus’s death and resurrection is more proof of God’s power and uniqueness than all the plagues combined. 

And yet, like the plagues of Egypt, people look at Jesus and his cross and come up with a thousand different explanations for what it is and why it doesn’t matter to them (1 Corinthians 1:23). 

The only difference between those who look at the cross and see nothing worthwhile and those who look at the cross and see Jesus bearing the punishment we deserved, is God graciously softening hard hearts. If it wasn’t for that, we would always be Pharaoh and never Moses. We would always be Egypt and never Israel. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who softens hearts so that we don’t end up like Pharaoh. And Jesus as the one who did everything to bear your plagues, change your heart, and move you to repent and follow him."

Moses is still on Mount Sinai when his time with God gets interrupted.

The Israelites below have made an idol (Exodus 32:4). The idol served many roles for the people. 

It was a more palatable representation of God’s image than the big thundering cloud on the mountain. 

They also thought this idol could represent them to the big God on the mountain, since Moses had been away for so long. 

They may have even thought that this extra god would have made them more successful in the military battles they would soon fight. 

God tells Moses that he is going to punish those who did this (Exodus 32:10). Moses intercedes, but when he sees the idolatry for himself, he commands all those who participated be killed (Exodus 32:27). 

Moses goes back up the mountain and offers his own life on behalf of the rest of Israel. But God says he will punish everyone who worshipped the idol, and does so, soon after, with a plague (Exodus 32:35). 

Moses begs God to dwell in the tabernacle and lead them into the promised land like he planned (Exodus 33:15). Unlike the idol worshippers who settled for a manmade image, Moses wanted nothing but God himself. Amazingly, God agrees. 

Then Moses makes the bold request to see God’s glory (Exodus 33:18). And, again, God says yes. God would show Moses all his goodness. But Moses could not see God’s face. Because if he looked at God’s glory, full on, he would die. So God puts Moses behind a rock with a small crack in it and makes his glory pass by. 

This encounter makes Moses’ face shine with the glory of God (Exodus 34:29b). Unlike the idol which tried to be the image of God and shine with gold, when Moses saw the real image of God he became like him and shone with God’s actual glory.  

Where is the Gospel? 

The ultimate reason Israel wasn’t to make any idols of God is because there could be only one true visible representation of Yahweh - the person of Jesus. 

And Jesus does everything Israel wanted this false god to do. Jesus intercedes for us, shows us the image of God, and leads us into God’s promises. 

Jesus also goes before us like Moses tried to go before God. Moses asked that God would blot him out as a substitute for those who sinned. But God would not allow it. Amazingly, what God would not do to Moses he does himself in the person of Jesus. 

Jesus is a better intercessor than Moses as well. Moses did not succeed in saving the idol worshippers from God’s wrath or his own. Jesus, however, takes the wrath we deserved and instead of being angry with us in our sin, he shows us nothing but love (Romans 5:8). 

Jesus does not dwell in a tent, or behind a rock, or through a messenger like an angel - he is God’s presence itself (Hebrews 1:3). How remarkable is it that this glory that would kill us if we saw it, became flesh and was instead killed for us? 

And now, because of Jesus, we can see what Moses saw - the light of Jesus’ face. And when we do this we are changed like Moses’ face was changed (2 Corinthians 3:18). The more we look at the Gospel of Jesus, the more we are transformed into the image of God. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who is present with undeserving people, and Jesus as the final intercessor who makes that presence possible."

Israel has made it out of Egypt. They are now traveling to Mount Sinai, where God first spoke to Moses in the burning bush. 

But on their way, they begin to complain that they are hungry. They start blaming Moses and even regretting the fact that God freed them from slavery (Exodus 16:3). 

Despite their lack of appreciation and faith, God is still faithful. He sends bread from heaven in the morning, and quail from heaven in the evening (Exodus 16:4). The people are allowed to gather as much as they need for their family, but they were not to keep any food overnight. God wanted them to trust that he would provide what they needed every day. 

There was one exception to the rule of not keeping any leftovers. On the seventh day of the week the  people were to rest from all their work, even just gathering food (Exodus 16:26). This day of rest was called the Sabbath. It was a weekly reminder that the people can rest from their work because God will provide. 

So, on the day before the Sabbath, they were allowed to gather twice as much so they needed and keep it for the next day. But even with this double provision, people still went out and searched for more food on their day of rest (Exodus 16:27). They didn’t trust God to provide. 

Where is the Gospel? 

In the Gospel of John, Jesus teaches that there is a truer bread from heaven when he says,“I am the bread of life.” The truest bread from heaven is Jesus himself. It is his body that he gave for us on the cross. 

For the Israelites ate the bread from heaven, but still grew old and died. But anyone who eats of Jesus, the true bread, will never die. That is because Jesus died to give us his life. 

But how do we eat Jesus? We believe in him (John 6:35).

This truth leads us to finally take a true Sabbath rest every day of our lives. 

We do not have a scarcity of salvation, we are fully saved in Christ. We do not need to hoard up merits or favor with God for a rainy day when we happen to sin more than usual. Jesus’ blood is new every morning and purifies us daily (1 John 1:9).

We can enter into a perpetual Sabbath rest. We can rest from our laborious work. We do not have to earn our salvation. We can rest in the fact that it is finished. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit gives you eyes to the God who always provides exactly what his people need because he want to give them peace. And that you would see Jesus as the bread of life who brings us our final Sabbath rest."

Moses is talking with God on Mt. Sinai when he receives the plans for a movable structure called a tabernacle. This is the tent in which God would dwell with his people as they journeyed from Mount Sinai to the Promised Land (Exodus 26:1).  

God has always wanted to live with his people. That’s what the Garden of Eden was for. And now, in the tabernacle, God is making the first giant step in restoring the presence he had with humanity back in Eden. 

Basically, the instructions for how to build this tent start at the center and work their way out. The mercy seat in the holy of holies is the central part of the tabernacle. We can think of it like a king’s throne (Exodus 25:22). This is where God would appear and meet with his people, like he met with Moses on the mountain. 

Next, there is the bread of the presence which represents the 12 tribes of Israel (Exodus 25:23). In front of that is the golden lampstand which continuously shines on the bread (Exodus 25:31). This was to be a constant testament to the fact that God’s presence is with his people. 

Outside of the tent, in the outer court of the tabernacle, there an altar (Exodus 27:1). The altar is where sacrifices would be made. This reveals that people cannot just approach God as they are. Their sin must be dealt with through sacrifice. 

Everything in the tabernacle is sectioned off by curtains. The more dense and ornate they become, the closer one would get to the holy presence of God (Exodus 26:31). This fact shows us that the closer people get to God the more protection is needed. The structure of the tabernacle conveys one strong message - God is holy. He is set apart, glorious, and perfect. 

Where is the Gospel?

Which is what makes Jesus coming to earth so magnificent. Jesus is the final tabernacle because he is the tent in which God fully dwells in the flesh (John 1:14). 

But Jesus doesn’t just fulfill the tabernacle itself, but every part of the tabernacle. He is the actual holy of holies because he is the actual presence of God (Colossians 1:19). Jesus is the bread of life who is present for his people (John 6:35). He is the light of the world that shines on them eternally with his protection (John 8:12). He is the final sacrifice on the altar that allow us to enter into the holy place of God (Hebrews 10:12). 

Furthermore, at Jesus’ death the curtain covering the holy of holies ripped open to show that there is no longer separation from God and his people. All who belong to Jesus have been turned into little tabernacles in which he dwells through the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16). And eventually, Jesus will return and transform the whole world into his new tabernacle (Revelation 21:3). For he will dwell in it with us forever. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who is unapproachable holy, but still wants to dwell with his people. And that you would see Jesus as the one who made a way for this good God to live with us and in us forever."

So far in Leviticus, we have seen descriptions of the sacrifices. These sacrifices needed priests to carry them out. But last we saw from Aaron, the head priest in the book of Exodus, he was begging for his life after building Israel an idol in the shape of a golden calf (Exodus 32:22).  

Here, we see that God has provided a way for Aaron and his sons to be forgiven of this terrible sin and serve inside his tabernacle as priests.  

Aaron and his sons are ordained as priests after following all the commands God gave back in Exodus 29 (Leviticus 8:5). Then they carry out the sacrifices Leviticus has commanded so far (Leviticus 8:14). 

The result of this obedience is tremendous. God revealed his glory and sent fire to consume the burnt offering. 

But, then, only one verse later, fire comes out from God again. This time, it is not the fire of acceptance, but the fire of judgement. 

That’s because Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, disobeyed God’s commands. They brought a different fire into God’s presence than the one he lit (Leviticus 10:1). So God’s fire consumes them. 

God showed his glory to the people when he consumed the sacrifice. Here, God shows his holiness to the people by sending his fire of judgement. After this incident, God says, “Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified” (Leviticus 10:3). 

God will show those who come near him that he is holy and set apart. And whether in worship or in judgement God’s glory will be displayed to all. 

Where is the Gospel? 

So how can we come near God without being consumed? Jesus is our answer. 

Jesus is the final high priest who perfectly obeyed every command of God. Therefore, he did not have to go through a process of ordination where blood was spilled to pay for his sins (Hebrews 7:27).

And since he shed his own blood for us we can approach God with boldness; not because of our goodness or accomplishments, but because we know that Jesus perfectly represents us before God (Hebrews 4:16). 

The fire we deserve to have consume us was fully extinguished upon Christ’s body on the cross (Romans 5:9). And like the fire on the altar showed God’s acceptance of Israel’s sacrifice, so the fire of the Holy Spirit that indwells believers today shows that we have been made into acceptable living sacrifices to God (Romans 12:1). 

Our ability to draw near to God is not based on how well we follow rules. The reason why we are not consumed by God’s holiness is because his holiness has come to live in us. He makes us fully acceptable so that we can be a kingdom of priests that never perish (1 Peter 2:9). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God of perfect holiness and tremendous glory. And that you would see that Jesus is the only way we can enter into God’s holy presence and behold his glory with joyful worship."

After meeting God in the burning bush, Moses obeys his commands. He travels to Egypt, shows God’s miracles to Israel’s leaders, and commands Pharaoh to let the Israelites go. 

But things don’t go as Moses or the Israelites expected. Pharaoh say no to Moses’ request and increases his persecution against the Israelites (Exodus 5:7). 

Understandably, Moses and the people are confused and angry. If they were God’s people and if Moses had obeyed, why were these bad things happening?

This confusing situation leads Moses to ask God a very difficult question, “Why have you done evil to this people?” (Exodus 5:22).  

But God doesn’t explain, justify, or defend himself. He simply repeats his promise to Moses (Exodus 6:6). Everything is still going according to his plan. Suffering has not thwarted God’s will. 

God also takes his promise a step further by adding to it. Not only will he save Israel, he will do so by punishing their enemies (Exodus 6:1). 

God will hold Pharaoh and the Egyptians accountable for their evil through what he calls, “Great acts of judgement.” These are the famous plagues that are about to occur. Through them, Egypt will be judged and Israel will be saved. 

Where is the Gospel?

No wicked event, no matter the size of the suffering it created, has turned back God’s plan to save the world. But it doesn’t always seem like that is true. Even when we seem to be doing the right thing, we still suffer. We ask the question, “Why do bad things happen to good people?” 

The problem for us though is that we only want to identify with the suffering Israelites, wondering why things sometimes get worse even when we obey God. 

But we need to see that we are are also like Pharaoh. Our own wicked actions are often the answer to the question, “Why do bad things happen?” 

Therefore, God has every right to treat us like he would treat Egypt. He has every right to hold us accountable through great acts of judgement (Psalm 145:20). 

But Jesus willfully put himself under the weight of all our evil, and suffered by it and for it. In that moment, Jesus could have easily repeated the question Moses had asked centuries ago, “Why have you done this evil against me?” But in that moment of suffering on the cross, God brought about the fulfillment of his greatest plan.

The good news doesn’t stop there. Just as God promised to hold the evil of Egypt accountable, Jesus will also hold accountable all the evil that people have committed (2 Corinthians 5:10). No one has ever suffered who will not be avenged. No wrong will ever be done that will not be put right. 

This makes what Jesus does for those he saves all the more beautiful. We deserve to be held accountable for the suffering we have brought into the world. But instead, for those who will trust in him, Jesus takes the great acts of judgement they deserve and gives us freedom. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who is faithful through our suffering and holds evil accountable. And may you see Jesus as the one who is faithful to us by holding himself accountable for the evil we commit."

Moses is on the mountain with God. He has received the Ten Commandments, and now God is going to expand and explain them. 

Quickly we find out that God hates injustice and oppression, but loves fairness and honesty. 

That’s why wrongs must be made right. But, God requires punishment always be proportionate to the crime. If someone steals an animal from your farm, you cannot, then, take revenge on that person’s family members. It must be fair. Eye for an eye. Tooth for tooth (Exodus 21:23-24).

We also see that God is compassionate. He sets up laws that are wildly progressive for this time in history (Exodus 22:22). These laws are on behalf of those lowest in their society: slaves, woman, foreigners, and the poor. 

God wants a society where people are treated fairly, where justice is upheld, and where the marginalized are provided for. 

God wants a world that looks like him. And his method of creating it is to create a people who look like him. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus himself picks up on these laws in his teaching (‭Matthew‬ ‭5:38-40‬). But, like the social laws in Exodus, his teaching about the law was not only about our obedience. The way Jesus spoke about the law shows us who he is and what he was on earth to do. 

For we have done evil to God. We deserved eye for eye punishment for that. But Jesus turned the other cheek, and took the eye-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth punishments we deserved on the cross. Jesus is the only one who never broke a single one of God’s laws, but died as if he did on behalf of those who had (2 Corinthians 5:21). 

Even more, the kind of just and fair society the law tried to make through its commands, is actually fulfilled in the people who are saved by Jesus. 

By perfectly fulfilling the social laws toward us, Jesus trains us into people who can fulfill them toward others. Since he loved us when we were poor, marginalized, foreigners, we can love anyone from anyone, no matter their standing, position, or background (1 John 4:19). 

Jesus puts his own Spirit within us that actually forms us into his own image. God is creating a society, in his church, that provides for the vulnerable and defends the defenseless (John 13:35). 

But the ultimate and perfect society God wants to create is still in the future. When Jesus returns he will finally create the perfect society that reflects his character (Revelation 21:4). There will be no tears, no pain, and people will live at peace with one another.

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God of compassion and justice behind these laws. And Jesus as the one who extends this compassion to us by receiving our justice."

The book of Exodus picks up right where Genesis left off. 

God promised that one of Adam and Eve’s children would reverse the curse and beat death (Genesis 3:15). So their family line is traced throughout Genesis in several genealogies, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God said this line would be so fruitful that it would multiply and cover the whole earth with a blessing (Genesis 12:2).  

But by the end of Genesis, the promise isn’t fulfilled yet. 

So in the opening pages of Exodus, we find that the story isn’t over and the promise is not lost. Because the genealogy that opens the book of Exodus is Eve, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob’s family tree (Exodus 1:1). The promise is still active. 

400 years have passed since the end of Genesis and God’s promised people are enslaved by Egypt, tortured by their captors, and their children are being systematically killed by that nation’s leader Pharaoh (Exodus 1:10). 

But what we should notice in these first two chapters is that not even Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, can prevent God’s promise. God’s people would grow abundantly and produce the promised descendent of Adam and Eve, no matter what kind of evil stood against them (Exodus 1:12a). 

Through Pharaoh’s oppression, in fact even because of it, God raises up the deliverer for his people - a man named Moses, whom God will use to save his people, deliver them from death, and bring them to himself (Exodus 2:10). 

Exodus lets us see behind the scenes of suffering and hopelessness. It shows us that, even when things look so terrible that they must be outside of God’s plan, God is still working to provide for his people and make good on his promises. 

Where is the Gospel?

There is another place in the Bible that feels very similar to turning the page from Genesis to Exodus. It’s when we turn the page from what we know as the Old Testament to the New Testament. 

God’s people are, again, far from their promised land and are under oppression from a foreign power. There is, again, around 400 years of waiting. All this time has passed and people are still waiting on the promise God made to Eve to be fulfilled. And what happens when we turn the page and read the first words of Matthew in the New Testament? We see a genealogy (Matthew 1:1). 

The point is to show us that God has made good on his promise to Eve, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because Jesus has come from this same family tree. Jesus is the one descendent of Eve, who defeats evil and brings us back to live with God. 

Much like the story of Israel in Egypt, in Jesus, God’s plan was accomplished through suffering. There is a murderous a king, a flight to Egypt, rejection by his people, mockery and torture by the political powers, and ultimately death on a cross. But through these, Jesus showed that God’s plan was still working, even in the worst circumstances. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who works all things, even the worst things, together for good. And may you see Jesus as the one who fulfills God’s promises despite everything evil did to try to stop him."

After the final plague, Pharaoh finally releases Israel to go and worship God. The slaves begin their flight, but are soon stopped by a large body of water that looks as if it will add days to their journey. We know this body of water as the Red Sea. 

But during their flight, Pharaoh has had a change of heart (Exodus 14:4). He does not want the Israelites to go, and so he and all his chariots chase after them. When the Israelites see Pharaoh and his army closing in, they lament that they ever left Egypt at all (Exodus 14:12). 

But God tells these doubting, fearful Israelites to be silent and watch the salvation God himself will work for them (Exodus 14:14). All they must do is be silent. God will do it all. 

Through Moses, God splits the sea to open up a path for the Israelites to walk through safely on dry ground. However, when Pharaoh, motivated by his hard heart, follows follows after them, God closes the waters around them and destroys him and his whole company. In one act, the parting and closing of the Red Sea, God both saved and punished. He both rescued and judged. 

Once Israel is on the other side of the Red Sea, we get to hear the song of Moses (Exodus 15:1). This song is like one an army would sing after winning a great victory. But Israel did no fighting. God did everything. Which is why, the whole song is about God’s might and power over Egypt and their false gods. 

God says that through this event, he has gotten glory over Pharaoh and shown the whole world that there is no God like Israel’s God! 

Where is the Gospel? 

The parting and closing of the Red Sea is a grand and beautiful picture of what Jesus did on the cross for us.

Jesus saves us in spite of all our unbelief and hostility. Like God did for Israel, Jesus does it all for us. We just get to look at God fighting for us and winning our salvation on the cross. 

In one act, Jesus saved us and defeated the enemies of sin and death (Romans 3:26). With one act, using one instrument, God saved his people and punished sin like he did at the Red Sea. 

This is some of the imagery we are supposed to see in our own baptism (1 Corinthians 10:2). We go under the water and die like Egypt, leaving our sin and its punishment buried there. Only to come up like Israel on the other side, free from our oppressors and ready to live. 

And as Israel sang their victory song, declaring God’s glory and power over that of Pharaoh, we too sing a new song of victory. We go out into all the world with the song of the cross on our lips. Through his death and resurrection, Jesus proved that there is no power like his power and no authority like his authority (Matthew 28:18). God wins all the glory for himself in the Gospel of Jesus. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who wins salvation for his undeserving people. And Jesus as the one who fell under the waves of punishment for us, so that we might be saved."

Nine of the ten plagues have come upon Egypt. Pharaoh, with his hard heart, still will not change his mind and obey. So, God sends a tenth and final plague. 

God says that he is going to punish the Egyptians by bringing death to their firstborn (Exodus 11:5). The firstborn was a title, signifying who would carry the family name. 

In Pharaoh’s case, the firstborn would have taken the throne. By cutting off the line, God is saying that this evil, oppressive, idolatrous system of government and worship must come to an end. 

But everyone in Egypt participated in the worship of false gods and the oppression of Israel. By taking the firstborn, God is saying, “I want all this evil to stop multiplying.” 

Like the other plagues, Egypt would be afflicted, but Israel would be spared. 

But unlike the other plagues, this time God gives a visible sign that distinguished saved Israel from punished Egypt (Exodus 12:7). If anyone would sacrifice a spotless lamb and spread its blood over the door of their homes, God would look at the blood and the punishment would passover them. 

But this wasn’t just a ritual, it was also a feast.

By the people eating their sacrifice, they were forced to understand, appreciate, and enjoy what God was doing for them (Exodus 12:11). 

This feast also became the starting point for Israel’s new yearly calendar. Every year, they were to remember this gracious act of God and eat the same meal (Exodus 12:17). 

Where is the Gospel? 

This story points us forward to what God has done for us in Jesus. 

The death of the firstborn in Egypt was God’s way of saying that this evil must stop. By Jesus dying on the cross God was putting evil to a stop once and for all.

Not only does he disarm the spiritual powers of evil by taking away their weapon of condemnation, he actually stops evil from multiplying within us. 

When we are saved, the Holy Spirit begins a new work in us (Ephesians 2:10). Now we can do good instead of evil. 

The New Testament calls Jesus our Passover lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7). It was no accident that Jesus’s death took place during the time when Israel was celebrating the Passover feast. He was showing that his death was the fulfillment of all the lambs slain to save the people of Israel. 

Now, anyone who puts their trust in what Jesus earned for them, his blood covers them like the lamb’s blood covered the Israelites’ doors. In the same way, God’s punishment passes us over. 

Christians still participate in the Passover feast today. Whether you know it as the Lord’s Supper, Communion, the Eucharist, or by some other name, Christians have been eating this bread and drinking this wine for the last two thousand years. When we eat this meal, we remember the lamb that was slain that made it so we could be passed over from the judgement we deserved (Luke 22:19). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God of grace who passed you over even when you deserved death, and may you see Jesus clearly today as the Passover lamb who died so you might live."

God has just finished prescribing the festivals Israel is supposed to hold annually. 

These festivals are based around the idea of the Sabbath - that every seven days no ordinary work is to be done. This weekly ritual is to remind people that God made the world and rested on the seventh day and he is still in charge. They can rest from their work and trust God to provide. 

The number seven is popping up everywhere. Just before it are seven yearly festivals, most of which fall within the seventh month, during which seven days of rest are taken. But then every seventh year is a Sabbatical year (Leviticus 25:4). In the Sabbatical year, all farmland must rest and not be planted or harvested. 

Finally, after every seven times seven years, was the year of Jubilee. After 49 years, on the 50th year, there was basically a mega-Sabbath (Leviticus 25:8). All debts were canceled, all land went back to its original owner, and all Israelite slaves were released. 

This was an unprecedented act of social justice that was put in place to make sure that no one became disproportionately poor or rich over multiple generations. Twice a century the whole nation was to push “reset.” 

Where is the Gospel? 

We have no evidence that Israel actually ever obeyed this mega-Sabbath, this year of Jubilee. Which makes it even more beautiful when we realize that Jesus claimed to be the bringer of the final year of Jubilee. 

In Luke 4, we read about Jesus walking into a synagogue in Nazareth claiming that he was the one bringing this year of Jubilee, also known as the year of the Lord’s favor (Luke 4:19). 

And he did! He truly canceled all debts. Not just earthly debts for a few years. He canceled all our eternal, spiritual debt (Colossians 2:14). 

He didn’t just restore property, he gave us a land that was never even ours to begin with - the land of the new heavens and the new earth in which we will dwell with him forever (John 14:2). 

And he fully and finally freed slaves that had never been freed before (Romans 6:17). He freed us from our slavery to death and our slavery to sin. 

Jesus truly brought the mega-Sabbath. Which is why, in Christ, we can take a Sabbath every day (Hebrews 4:9). We can rest every single moment in the fact that Jubilee has come into this world, has canceled our debts, given us a new land, and freed us from slavery. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who cares for the poor and the slaves. And that you would see Jesus as the one who finally and fully provided for the poor and the slaves in his death, burial, and resurrection."

The sacrificial system Leviticus has described doesn’t stand on its own. It is part of a larger covenant between Israel and God. 

The covenant was made in Exodus (Exodus 19:5). If Israel obeyed God’s commands, he would dwell with them, make them into a great nation, and bring them into the promised land. 

If Israel obeys God’s commands, they will be richly blessed. They will live safely in the Promised Land with God and ample physical provisions (Leviticus 26:6). 

But if the people break the covenant, God will break out against them. Multiple times, God says he will avenge them sevenfold for their sins. He will kick them out of the land, bring their enemies against them, and they will die (Leviticus 26:17). 

In fact, the specificity of the punishment makes it seem like this is exactly what will happen. 

But, God offers a lifeline to this future people. He says that if they repent and soften their hearts toward God, he will return them to the land and bless them once again (Leviticus 26:40). 

God says that even though his people will utterly forsake him, God will still keep the covenant (Leviticus 26:44). He will bring them back despite their sin. He will change their hearts no matter how hard they are. He will give them life no matter how close to death they come. 

This is God’s vow to his people. 

Where is the Gospel?  

Later in their story, Israel was in exile. Enemies occupied their land. But in this dire season, God did not abandon his people. Instead, he did the opposite. He came in the flesh and actually lived with them. He pitched a different tent, the tabernacle of his human body in the person of Jesus (John 1:14).

Jesus accomplished absolutely everything prescribed in the book of Leviticus. He was the final offering, the final day of atonement, and the ultimate covenant keeper. 

Yet, he who kept the covenant for us did not receive the blessings described in this passage. Instead, he received our sevenfold curses. This number 7 should remind us of at least two things from Jesus’ ministry. 

He taught that he was bringing the final year of Jubilee, which was the seven times seventh year in Israel’s calendar (Luke 4:18-19). He also taught that we must forgive seven times seven when people sin against us (Matthew 18:22). Jesus takes our sevenfold punishment so that he could give us seven times seven blessings and forgiveness. 

Now we who are in exile anywhere on this earth, no matter who we are, no matter what we’ve done, no matter how unrepentant and hard our hearts are, we can come to Jesus, put our hand on him through faith and receive all the covenant blessings of God (Ephesians 2:5). 

We can be present with God. He will give us every spiritual blessing in Christ. And we will live with him forever in the new heavens and the new earth. 

See for Yourself 

I pray the Holy Spirit will give you eyes to see the God who takes his covenant so seriously that no matter how much we break it, he never will. And that you will see that it is only because of Jesus that those of us who should have been cut off from God forever, can be brought near him forever instead."

Two main topics make up this section: (1) the perpetual fire (2) the priest’s food.

The fire on the altar at the entrance of the tabernacle is never to go out. God will soon miraculously light the first sacrifice himself (Lev. 9:24). Keeping this original fire alive is a sign of God himself accepting each sacrifice.

Additionally, smoke is a common symbol of God’s presence in the Old Testament (Exodus 19:18). The constant smoke from the fire would be a regular reminder of God’s presence among the people. 

Finally, it was to be a steady sign of the people’s need for forgiveness. But it would also be a reminder that atonement had already been made. 

Next, rules are given to the priests about who can eat what, where, and when (Leviticus 7:10).  

Many of the sacrifices ended in a meal for the priests. Their food is called most holy. No one else is allowed to eat that food (Leviticus 7:6). It was set apart for the priests. 

That’s because this food spread holiness (Leviticus 6:18b). Whatever touched the holy flesh from the sacrifice became holy itself. The priests were symbolically being made holy on the inside. 

Where is the Gospel? 

All of this is significant for those of us who believe in Jesus. 

The only perpetual fire we read about in the New Testament is the fire of Hell (Jude 1:7). Just as the sacrifices made on the altar were a picture of what each individual worshipper deserved because of their sin, the perpetual fire of Hell is what each of us deserves because of our own sin. 

However, Jesus got on the altar in our place. His atonement is now perpetual. Jesus never ceases to stand at God’s right hand, constantly interceding for us (Hebrews 7:25).

The fire from heaven that fills the tabernacle today is not a physical flame, but the Holy Spirit living within us. We are commanded to never extinguish the Holy Spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:19). We also have a promise that the Spirit inside of us is a guarantee of God’s acceptance of us and presence with us (2 Corinthians 1:22). 

What’s more, it is not just a certain class of people who are allowed to eat from the sacrifice Jesus made. He tells all who believe in him to eat his flesh (John 6:35). We do this in the Lord’s Supper, taking hold of our sin offering, Jesus, through faith as we remember through the bread and cup. 

And amazingly, what was symbolically true of the priests is actually true in Jesus. The Holy Spirit actually makes us holy on the inside. He transforms us from the inside out, giving us a new heart and remaking us into the holy image of Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:18). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who is always present with us to make us holy through Jesus, the final holy meal we all can come to and eat."

Multiple times a year, Israel is commanded to hold community feasts or ceremonies. There are seven festivals: passover, unleavened bread, weeks, solemn rest day, day of atonement, booths, day after booths. 

Passover reminded people of the Passover lamb they ate to escape the tenth plague in Egypt (Leviticus 23:5). 

In the Feast of Unleavened Bread, also treated as the Feast of  First Fruits, the first harvest reaped from each person’s field was offered to the Lord (Leviticus 23:10). This was a sign of thankfulness for what he provided and trust that he would provide the rest. 

50 days after the Feast of Unleavened Bread is the Feast of Weeks, called Pentecost in the New Testament. During this festival offerings are brought to God, thanking him for the full harvest (Leviticus 23:17). 

The seventh month is important. Its first day is signaled by trumpets which usher in a day of solemn rest (Leviticus 23:24). 

Then comes the Day of Atonement when all the people’s sins are dealt with for the year (Leviticus 23:27). 

Next in the seventh month is the Feast of Booths when all the people are called to construct little tents (Leviticus 23:34), reminding them of the temporary shelters they lived in after God rescued them from Egypt. 

Concluding the festivals each year was another day of rest (Leviticus 23:36b). 

The point of these feasts is to create holy time, which roots people in God’s saving work and renews their trust in and obedience to him. 

Where is the Gospel? 

The New Testament explicitly ties these feasts to Jesus. 

Jesus’ death on the cross coincides with Passover. He is the sacrificial lamb whose blood allows God’s wrath to pass us over (Matthew 26:18). 

Easter coincides with the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Jesus’ resurrection is the first fruits of the harvest God will make from the dead (Colossians 1:18). 

On the day of Pentecost, while Israel was celebrating the gift of the harvest, the first Christians celebrated the gift of the Spirit of God and the harvest of believers that would soon follow (Acts 2:4). 

Jesus also brought the final Day of Atonement, when, on the cross, he paid for the sins of all who would believe in him (Hebrews 9:12). 

A final trumpet will blow at Jesus’ return, ushering in a final day of perpetual rest (1 Corinthians 15:52). 

Finally, Jesus fulfills the feast of booths. When he was transfigured into glory on a mountain, Peter suggested setting up booths (Mark 9:5). This was to show that Jesus is the same God who showed up on Mt. Sinai in Exodus. 

We must constantly, daily, remember what Jesus has done for us in his death, burial, and resurrection. If we don’t, we will fall victim to the same fate as the man stoned to death in the story right after these feasts are described (Leviticus 24:11). Remembrance is the cure to blasphemy and sin. 

May your days be steeped in Jesus’ holy time.

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who gives us tangible ways to remember his salvation. And that you would see Jesus as the fulfillment of all the ways he saves."

Leviticus picks up right where Exodus left off. 

At the end of Exodus, after the tabernacle is completed, God fills the tent with his glory. But his presence is too holy, so not even Moses is able to enter (Exodus 40:35). 

So the question Exodus leaves us with is, “How can we live in God’s presence?”  

The answer Leviticus gives is atonement. 

Atonement has a range of meaning, but can basically mean either wiping clean or paying a ransom price. In order for sinful people to come into God’s presence, they need to be cleaned up and their sin needs to be paid for. But how? The answer is offerings. 

But the offerings God prescribes in Leviticus must not be seen as humanity’s attempt to appease God or earn his favor. Instead, the offerings in Leviticus are God’s gracious gift to  humanity that allow them to be forgiven and live near God’s presence. 

The first three offerings in Leviticus are the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the peace offering.

In a burnt offering the worshipper takes a whole animal and burns it on the altar (Leviticus 1:6-7). This was the costliest sacrifice, because no part of the animal was kept for food. 

In a grain offering, the worshipper brings bread or whole grain to the priests (Leviticus 2:1). A portion is burned on the altar, the rest is given to the priests for food. 

In a peace offering, the worshipper brings an animal (Leviticus 3:2). But unlike the burnt offering, most of it is given back to the worshipper to eat with their family in God’s presence.  

This final meal is the beauty of Leviticus. Humans sitting down to a meal with God. 

Where is the Gospel? 

This is our story too. In order for us to be in God’s presence and be his people, Jesus fulfilled every aspect of this system of sacrifice. 

Jesus is the true whole offering who gave himself completely for us on the cross to earn our atonement (Romans 8:32). 

Jesus is the final grain offering who provided the final sacrifice of his own body, which he called the “bread of life” (John 6:35). And as the grain offering provided food for the priests, Jesus’ sacrifice is what sustains all believers as his new priests to the world (2 Corinthians 4:10). 

Finally, Jesus is also the fulfillment of the peace offering. We get to sit down to a communal meal with God and other believers now, in the Lord’s Supper. But, when Jesus returns we will sit down to a final meal with him physically present at the table at the marriage supper of the lamb (Revelation 19:9). 

Jesus is the whole offering that makes atonement, the grain offering that sustains us, and the peace offering by which we commune with God. 

See for Yourself

A priest is an individual who represents others before God. The laws in this passage detail what the priests are supposed to wear, especially when they enter the tabernacle (Exodus 28:2). 

Each piece of clothing servers a point and communicates a truth. For example, the 12 precious stones that are set in the priest's chest piece represent the 12 tribes of Israel. This was a symbol to all the people that the priest was entering into God’s presence on their behalf. 

But the clothing is not only symbolic, but protection. God says the clothes would bear the punishment the priests deserved (Exodus 28:30). So, if a priest went into God’s presence without these garments on, they would to bear their own punishment and die (Exodus 28:35). 

The same is true of the sin and food offerings. They pay for the sins of the priests so that they may enter into God’s presence. That is why the priests were commanded to lay their hands on these sacrifices before they were offered (Exodus 29:19). It was a visible sign of their sin being transferred. 

But the sacrifices were not only there to pay for the priest’s sins. They were also part of the priest’s ordination, their swearing in (Exodus 29:1). These special sacrifices set them apart to do the work God laid out for them to do. 

The good news here is that God is making a way to live with his people (Exodus 29:45). This is all worth it because of God’s presence.

Where is the Gospel?

But Jesus is our better priest in so many ways. 

Jesus did not need any special garments to enter God’s presence because he was already perfect. On the contrary, he gives us his garments of perfection so that, like the priests here in Exodus, we can enter into God’s presence when we are clothed in Christ (Galatians 3:27). 

When we wear the clothes of Christ through faith, he takes our punishment and brings us into the presence of God unharmed. 

Jesus did not need to offer a sacrifice for his own sins because he was sinless. So he gave himself as the perfect sacrifice to be our sin offering before the Lord so that we might enter in. 

The priests had to constantly offer sacrifices for their own sins (Hebrews 10:11). But Jesus offered one sacrifice for all so that we could have one priest forever interceding for us (Hebrews 10:12). 

And as the priests here were appointed to their role through specific sacrifices, Jesus was appointed to his eternal role by the merit of a better offering - his own flesh and blood. 

Through Jesus we are made acceptable and holy before God. Now we can dwell with God and be his people. 

Furthermore, through this one high priest, Jesus, all believers are made into priests as well (1 Peter 2:9). Because we are now filled with the presence of God - the Holy Spirit. We are now called to represent God to the world, shining the light of his holiness by sharing the good news that made us clean.

In order for Israel to live near God’s presence in the tabernacle, they must be holy as God is holy. 

One of the main ways this holiness is maintained is through the work of the priests.

Therefore, the priests must be holy as they purify people of their sin because they are representing their holy God (Leviticus 21:6). 

For that reason, priests with blemishes and deformities are prohibited from carrying out the priestly responsibilities (Leviticus 21:17). That is not because God doesn’t love or accept these people, but because God must be represented as perfect. 

In fact, those who are disallowed from functioning as priests still get to share in the priest’s benefits, such as a right to eat the food brought for sacrifice (Leviticus 21:22). 

Not only must the priests be perfect, but the sacrifices they bring to the altar for themselves and for the whole nation must also be perfect. No one may bring any animal that has a blemish, deformity, or anything else that makes it less than desirable (Leviticus 22:20). 

In a culture where meat is rare and animals are a main source of income, nothing is more costly than giving up a perfect animal from your flock. The gift must be valuable. 

The sacrifice is also representing the cleanliness and perfection the worshipper was requesting be granted them from God. The worshipper was already deformed and blemished by their imperfection. They needed a spotless sacrifice, then, to bear their blemishes and represent the purity given to them in the exchange. 

Where is the Gospel? 

These rules teach us so much about the beauty and sacredness of Jesus’ sacrifice. 

Jesus is the only high priest who truly never had a blemish, deformity, or sin that needed atonement (Hebrews 4:15). That gave him the right to enter into God’s presence on behalf of all people. 

What’s more, he is not only the perfect priest who brings the sacrifice without blemish, he is the spotless, perfect sacrifice himself. 

A spotless male lamb was very valuable to an Israelite, but nothing was more valuable than “the precious blood of Christ” which 1 Peter tells us was “like that of a lamb without blemish or spot” (1 Peter 1:19). For our sacrifice, God gave the very best heaven had to offer - his very self. 

And as the perfect priest and sacrifice, Jesus took our sickness, deformities, sin, and disease onto himself (Isaiah 53:4). Now, we are made whole, perfect, and acceptable through faith in him.

Here we learn about the Sin Offering. But the offering is not just made because of sin. It is made to do something to sin. 

So a helpful way to think about this sacrifice is as a “de-sin” offering because it removes both the penalty and the pollution caused by sin. 

That penalty of death is symbolically transferred onto the animal by the guilty party laying hands on it before it is killed (Leviticus 4:4). The transfer of guilt is underlined by these words repeated throughout this passage: “he will be forgiven” (Leviticus 4:31b).  

Sin’s pollution is also dealt with in this offering. 

Sin not only defiles the person who commits it, but the place where it is committed. So, when someone sins, the blood from the sin offering is placed on the altar outside the tent (Leviticus 4:30). 

The blood purifies the altar so that their sacrifices might, once again, be acceptable before God. 

But what happens when a priest sins? Or the whole nation of Israel? That’s when the purification has to go deeper. The blood is taken into the entrance of the Holy of Holies where God’s presence is (Leviticus 4:6). 

The higher the status of the sinner, the deeper the blood of purification must go. Not only is one person’s offering threatened, but Israel’s entire proximity to God’s presence. Therefore, the tabernacle as a whole must be “de-sinned.” 

Where is the Gospel?

When Jesus died for us on the cross, he made a way for us to be de-sinned. He is the final sin offering. 

By believing in Jesus, we symbolically put our hand on his head like those in Leviticus did with the animal. We put our faith in the fact that Jesus’ death dealt with the penalty our sins deserved and we are forgiven (Romans 4:24-25).

His blood also cleanses the temple of our bodies so that God, in his Spirit, may come dwell in us (1 John 1:7). 

Jesus’ blood not only makes a way for God to dwell with us, but for us to dwell with God. 

As we saw in Leviticus, the higher the status of the person making the sin offering, the deeper into the tabernacle the blood would have to go. So when Jesus, who has the highest status imaginable, made the sacrifice of his own blood, it wasn’t taken into the depths of an earthly tent, but into the very presence of God (Hebrews 9:24). 

Through his sacrifice, we have full access to God’s presence. What Leviticus and all its sacrifices do partially, Jesus does completely.

Have you ever wondered why the people of Israel couldn’t eat pigs? Or have you been curious what the kosher laws are all about? 

Well, in this passage God declares certain animals clean and other animals unclean (Leviticus 11:2). Clean animals could be eaten, while unclean animals must be avoided. 

In Leviticus, everything is either clean or unclean. These aren’t moral categories. So clean things are always good and unclean things aren’t always bad. 

These are ritual categories about what can and can’t come into God’s presence. 

If something is clean it means it’s allowed to be in God’s presence. If something is unclean, it cannot be in God’s presence. 

Cleanliness is also a picture of God’s set apart nature and perfection. By following the cleanliness codes, the people are showing that God is distinct and clean among the whole earth.  

But why the distinction between clean and unclean animals? 

The Bible never goes into detail about how God made this distinction.

What the Bible does show us is what the separation of clean and unclean animals represented. 

The issue was symbolic. Israel had been separated from the nations simply by God choosing them. They were clean, while many other nations were called unclean. In the same way, God chose some animals who would be clean and others that would be unclean. God made the separation. 

Israel’s diet was a physical representation of their distinction as God’s people. They ate clean animals. They were clean. The nations ate unclean animals. They were unclean. They were God’s chosen people, eating God’s chosen food. Symbolically, the point was, “You are what you eat.” 

Where is the Gospel? 

But something very unique happens to these laws when Jesus entered the scene. 

Jesus abolished the distinction between clean and unclean animals (Matthew 15:11). Through a series of teachings and visions, God overturned these food laws (Acts 10:15). Now no animal is unclean or clean.

But why would Jesus abolish this food law? 

The answer becomes clear when we understand the clean and unclean animals listed in Leviticus as symbols for Israel’s separation from the unclean nations. 

Under the new covenant, all people can be made clean through the cleansing provided by Jesus’ blood. Therefore, the good news of Jesus’ sacrifice isn’t just for one people group, but for all people.

That’s what’s amazing about the Lord’s Supper. No one who believes in Jesus is restricted from the meal. All nations can gather at this table with Jesus because Jesus can make anyone clean. By partaking of Christ’s cleanliness we become clean like Christ. In the best way possible, in Christ, we are what we eat.

Here we get our first law section in Leviticus mainly talking about blood and marriage. 

Two commands sum up this discussion about blood. First, the people could only make sacrifices at the tabernacle before God (Leviticus 17:3-4). Only God deserves worship and sacrifice, not the false gods they would encounter in the Promised Land. 

Second, the people were forbidden from eating an animal whose blood was not properly drained (Leviticus 17:10). They were not to eat blood. 

That is because life is in blood and blood is used for making atonement. It belongs to God. 

Further, contemporaries of Israel thought drinking blood gave them extra vitality and power. So drinking the blood of an ox would make you strong like an ox. But God wanted his people to know that he alone grants life and power to his people.

The second section is about sexuality. Here we see that God cares about marriage, women, children, and how we handle our bodies.

But the main point of these commands is to distinguish Israel from the other nations who practice all kinds of sexual immorality (Leviticus 18:3). God wants Israel to be faithful in their relationships, because God is faithful in his. Marital faithfulness is a picture of God’s covenant faithfulness to his people. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Both of these laws about blood and marriage get taken to new levels through Jesus’ teaching. 

In the Gospel of John, Jesus commanded people to drink his blood to get eternal life (John 6:56) Jesus was telling people to do something God explicitly told them not to do. Why would he do this? 

Jesus was telling the people present that they must put their trust in him as their ancestors put their trust in the sacrifices provided on the altar.

Life is in the blood. And Jesus’ blood not only pays for our debt of death, it also gives life to us who should have died. 

In faith, when we drink his blood we actually do get his power. We get the same power that raised Jesus from the dead - the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:11). 

If Israel’s relations with one another was to be a picture of God and his people, marriage today between a husband and a wife is to be an even greater picture of Jesus and his church (Ephesians 5:32). 

In the Gospels, Jesus calls himself our husband, or bridegroom (Matthew 9:15). Jesus is the true and faithful husband of anyone who puts their trust in him. Therefore, we are to love our spouse, be faithful to our spouse, and lay our lives down for our spouse as an outward picture to the world of what Jesus has done for us.

After talking about how animals can make the people of Israel unclean, Leviticus goes on to talk about how their bodies can make them unclean. 

Those who are unclean must be separated from the camp of Israel and from the tent of God, or they would die in their uncleanness by defiling God’s tabernacle (Leviticus 15:31). 

Separating those who are unclean is not about calling them evil. After all, some of those called unclean are women who has just given birth, people with skin inflammation, or those with some kind of persistent bleeding (Leviticus 12:2). These aren’t evil things, but just part of being human. 

Therefore, their separation is not about judgement, but protection. They are separated so they won’t defile God’s tabernacle and die. 

The two main types of bodily uncleanliness covered in this section are discharges of blood and skin diseases, often called leprosy (Leviticus 13:2). 

These are classified as unclean, because they make the person less than whole, or less than physically perfect. 

If the people are to be holy as God is holy (Leviticus 11:44), then any kind of imperfection, even physical, makes it so they must be separated from God and be called unclean. 

So how uncleanliness fixed? Through the sacrificial system of Leviticus. 

We must not forget, these rituals do not heal the person. The priests are not doctors, healing the sick. They are more like city inspectors, calling things what they are. The clean are declared clean, the unclean are not. 

They had nothing to do with people’s symptoms, only their status. 

After a person is made clean through the blood of sacrifice, both problems brought about by uncleanliness are solved. The uncleanliness won’t spread to the tabernacle and the individual can, once again, be close to God and his people. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Understanding all of this makes Jesus’s ministry all the more wondrous. 

All people are separated from God (Ephesians 2:12). It is as if our lives have been spent outside of God’s camp, unable to get in because of our uncleanliness.

But Jesus did not keep himself separated from those who were supposed to stay away from the tabernacle. Instead, he left the actual temple of God in heaven and came straight up to the unclean. He did this to show us that no one is outside of his reach. 

Unlike the priests in Leviticus who had to wait for an ailment to clear up before they could call anyone clean, Jesus instantly healed discharges of blood and people with unclean skin diseases (Matthew 8:3).

Jesus could change people’s symptoms and their status. He could declare them as ritually clean and physically healed. What Leviticus could only perform as a ritual, he performed as a reality. 

And the good news is, we don’t have to wait until our uncleanliness clears us to approach Jesus. We can’t spread our disease to him. In fact, the opposite is true. He comes out to us while we are still in our disease and spreads his holiness to us.

God is teaching his people how to live in his presence. Since God is set apart, or holy, Israel must be holy to dwell with him. 

Appropriately, then, this section begins and ends with a famous and important phrase: “Be holy as I, the LORD, am holy” (Leviticus 19:2). 

In between this repeated phrase are laws which unpack the Ten Commandments. The laws show Israel how to be holy. 

If Israel was unholy, God’s holiness would blot them out (Leviticus 19:8). 

That is why sins like murder, bestiality, and child sacrifice are punishable by death (Leviticus 20:9). By carrying out these punishments, Israel would represent God’s judgement and preserve their communion with God. 

When God says be holy as I am holy, he is not just telling them how to behave - he is telling them what he is like. 

When God says that we must care for the poor, we learn that God helps the needy (Leviticus 19:10). 

When God says that we must not lie, we learn that God always keeps his promises (Leviticus 19:11). 

When God says that we must love our neighbor as ourselves, we learn that God loves with perfect love (Leviticus 19:18). 

Where is the Gospel? 

There are, then, two elements here: what God commands and who God is. These two elements come together perfectly in Jesus. 

He showed us who God is by perfectly keeping God’s commands. He was perfectly holy as God is holy. 

That’s why Paul could write of Jesus, “He is the image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15). 

What should astound us is that this perfectly holy one died (2 Corinthians 5:21). He was the only one who would be allowed in God’s presence just on the basis of who he is. Yet, he was cast outside the city gates where Israel was commanded to take those who broke the law and kill them (Hebrews 13:12). 

But because he who perfectly kept the law, also perfectly took its punishments on our behalf, we don’t have to be cast out of God’s holiness. 

Most remarkably, Jesus actually makes us holy as God is holy (Hebrews 10:10). Now we have the right, through Jesus, to have close communion with God. 

Holiness isn’t just a state or title declared over Christians. It is also a lived condition. We have been made holy. That means, when Jesus transforms us into God’s holiness we actually start to keep the law that we could not keep before. 

We start to love people as we could never love them before (John 13:34). We start to reflect God’s character like Jesus did when he was alive. Jesus makes us holy so we can show God’s character to the world.

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who is perfectly holy and good. And that you would see Jesus as the only perfect one who, nevertheless, died the death of the guilty to make us holy people in an unholy world."

Sin has effects. 

It creates guilt (Leviticus 5:19). Guilt can be defined as remorse or contrition, but it can also be caused by fearing a punishment you know is coming. 

Sin also affects those around us. Others experience the toll our wrong actions take. 

If I steal something, I might feel guilty about it later. But the person from whom I stole also feels the loss immediately.

In the guilt offering is meant to deal with both of sin’s effects. 

After making the guilt offering, the worshipper could walk away from the tabernacle knowing that they are forgiven. 

But reparations are also paid alongside this offering. The priest would put a value on the damage caused by the sin, which the guilty person would repay, adding an additional 20% (Leviticus 5:16).  

This offering, therefore, deals with three relationships: (1) the vertical relationship between man and God, (2) the inner relationship between self and conscience, (3) and the horizontal relationship between man and man. 

Where is the Gospel? 

But the guilt offering is meant to point  us forward to Jesus’ offering. When we put our faith in Jesus’ final sacrifice, Hebrews 10:22 says that our consciences are sprinkled clean with the blood of Christ. We no longer have just an outward sign that our guilt is dealt with. We have the inner witness of Jesus through his Spirit that we have been made guiltless because of Jesus’ perfect guilt offering. 

Jesus also pays for the effects our sin has on the world around us. 

He fixes the effects of sin through us. Time and again in the New Testament, we see pictures of people who are so radically changed by the love of Jesus that they make above and beyond reparations for the bad ways they’ve treated people around them (Luke 19:8). Jesus changes us so we can change our world and others. 

But we can’t fix everything. Thankfully Jesus can, does, and will. He can work in people’s hearts to restore what we have broken. And what’s more, when he returns, he will fix everything that’s broken and make it perfect. He won’t add 20% to it. He will make everything 100% new. That’s why he says in the book of Revelation, “Behold, I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5).

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who not only deals with the penalty of sin but its effects on our conscience and world. And that you would see Jesus as the only one who can truly heal both."

The section continues a flashback to a month earlier when Moses dedicated the tabernacle.  

Everything Israel does in this passage mirrors the story of their escape from Egypt in Exodus.  

They keep the Passover meal on the one year anniversary of the first time they ate it (9:2). God commanded them to do this every year and remember how he saved their firstborn in Egypt. 

Next, we read about the cloud of God’s presence that covered the tabernacle. When the cloud lifted they traveled. When it rested they set up camp (9:22). This is very similar to what happened after the first Passover when the people went through the wilderness to Mt. Sinai, following the cloud of God’s presence (Ex 13:22). 

The last thing we read about in this flashback are commands about trumpets. Trumpets were to be used to signal different events and marching orders (10:2). This also reminds us of the Exodus story because after Passover and following the cloud, God’s presence came down on Mt. Sinai with the sound like a trumpet blast (Ex 19:16). 

Why all these similarities? 

Just before the book of Numbers began, Israel broke God’s covenant by building an idol - the famous golden calf. God punished them and it looked like all was lost. However, God renewed his covenant to Israel, the tabernacle was built, and that catches us up to where we are now. 

So the question is, what’s the status of the relationship between God and Israel? Are they ok? 

It’s almost as if God is saying, “I saved you then. I’ll save you know.” 

Where is the Gospel? 

This is great news for us today. We have sinned to the point of wondering, “What’s the status of my relationship with God?”

And like he did with Israel, God points us back to how he saved us before, in order to remind us of how he saves us now. But we don’t just remember the exodus from Egypt. We remember the new and better exodus we have been given in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. 

By rehearsing and remembering the story of how Jesus saves us, we are comforted by the fact that God is still with us. 

This is most clearly seen when we take the Lord’s Supper. Communion is the fulfillment of the Passover meal (Luke 22:20). When we take it we remember how we have been saved through the body and blood of Jesus. 

If you are in a season of doubt, if you are wondering how God could possibly still love you, remember that he died for you on the cross (Rom 8:32). The God who was faithful to you then is faithful to you today. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the lengths to which God goes to remind us of his covenant faithfulness. And, as you remind yourself of the Gospel, you would see Jesus as the full, final, and faithful keeper of that covenant."

After Israel’s failure to enter the Promised Land, and God’s promised punishment against the older generation, God gives commands to the younger generation that will apply when they return. 

The commands he gives are about sacrifices (15:2-3). This reaffirms that God will bring them into the land and make atonement for them through the sacrifices commanded in Leviticus. 

Things are looking up. We even see the people obeying God’s commands to put to death those who break the Sabbath (15:36). The people seem to be falling back into obedience again. 

But it doesn’t last long at all. 

Three Levites, create a rebellion of 250 leaders who rise up against Moses. They accuse Moses of exalting himself over everyone else (16:3).

But the book of Numbers makes it clear that these men didn’t have a problem with Moses, they had a problem with God (16:11). Not only that, but they were overlooking the privileged position they had already been given as Levites, separated from Israel to serve at God’s tent (16:9). 

What we see next is what happens when sin comes near a perfect God. God punishes these three men by opening the earth so that they fall in (16:32). He also punishes the 250 who followed them by consuming them with fire (16:35). 

The rebellion spread through the land as well. So God’s punishment followed in the form of a plague (16:46). Quickly Aaron took his own censer of incense and stood in the midst of the plague, between the living and the dead. The plague stopped, but not before claiming 14,700 lives (16:48-49). 

Stories like this can be hard to hear. But there are a few things we must remember. 

First, sinning against God is more serious than we want to admit. It is so serious that, even though it may be hard to wrap our minds around, those who sin deserve death. 

Second, God provides ways out of the punishment we deserve through intercession. Aaron’s censer of incense didn’t stop God’s plague by magic or because it overpowered what God was doing. God allowed the person he appointed to intercede for the people to do his job. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Most importantly, we need to see our own sin in this story. Like those who led this rebellion, we have questioned the one person God has appointed to speak to us on his behalf, earn our way into his presence, and be our ultimate leader. This person is Jesus. 

At different moments and in different ways, we all have disbelieved that Jesus is who he said he was (Romans 3:10–11). 

This is so much more offensive than what happened in Numbers. We deserve what they got and far worse. 

However, Jesus stood rushed into the middle of our plague. He offered up something more precious than incense - his life. 

He is the sin offering that we need to stay in God’s presence and enter into the Promised Land. 

Even though we have done things far worse than breaking the Sabbath, Jesus has stepped in and taken the death we earned. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who treats sin like it truly deserves, but always provides a way of escape. And that you would see and treasure Jesus as the only appointed intercessor God has given us."

Israel is traveling through the wilderness when they begin to grumble again, this time about a lack of water. So, God tells Moses and Aaron to speak to a certain rock, and it will gush out with water (20:8). 

But now, Moses and Aaron disobey both the method and the manner by which God told them to perform this miracle (20:11). For disobeying, God punishes both of them with the same punishment given to the older generation who would not enter Canaan  - they would die in the wilderness and not enter the Promised Land. 

After this, Moses sends representatives to the city of Edom to see if they could pass through their city on the way to the Promised Land of Canaan. God did not command them to do this, and their passage is refused (20:18). It seems things are breaking down. 

To cap it off, God says that it is time for Aaron to die. While this is a sober reminder of the punishment coming to Moses and the rest of the older generation, it is the beginning of the focus shifting to the younger generation. God promised this younger generation would enter the Promised Land. 

And the next story we read seems to confirm this promise. In fact, almost the whole of chapter 21 shows Israel obeying God’s voice, defeating massive armies, capturing cities, and making their way toward the Promised Land (21:3). 

But in the midst of all of this success, the older generation grumbles again. This time God punishes them by sending out poisonous snakes that bite the people so that they die (21:6). But the people confess their sin and beg Moses to make it stop. So God has Moses craft a bronze serpent, just like the ones that are biting the people (21:9). Anyone who looks at this bronze serpent after being bit will not die but will live.

Where is the Gospel? 

In the Gospel of John, Jesus says that he is like the bronze serpent (John 3:14-15). He too will be lifted up on a cross like the serpent was lifted up on a pole. He too will take the poison of sin that is killing the world on himself. 

And when we do look at him and believe, not only do the snakes of sin and death lose their sting, we get nourished with fresh water in the wilderness. For the New Testament also tells us that Jesus is the fulfillment of the rock in the wilderness (1 Cor 10:4). For he was struck like the rock to provide abundantly for a grumbling people who don’t deserve it. 

We deserve the punishment of Aaron, Moses, and the older generation. But God sent his son into the world to raise up a new generation of people who do not perish, who will triumph over the true enemies of God through truth and love, and who will enter into the final Promised Land. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that you would see the God who keeps his promises when we are faithless and who always provides even when we disobey him. And that you would see Jesus as the one to whom we look and do not perish, but have eternal life."

The old generation is gone. The new generation has been counted and talk of how to divvy up the Promised Land has already started. 

And in the midst of all this talk of numbers and land, we run into a long discourse about what sacrifices to offer on what days, at which festivals, during each part of the year. Why? 

At the beginning of Numbers, after the first generation was counted, God provided order to Israel based on space (Num 2:2). God’s tent was in the middle of the camp with the Levites and other tribes around it. God ordered his people based on holy space. 

But when each tribe has its own land in Canaan the old ordering of holy space will be unnecessary. So how are the people to orient themselves around God once they enter the Promised Land? 

The answer is no longer holy space. Now, it’s holy time. 

Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly festivals and sacrifices mark off Israel’s time as holy. 

Israel is to order their entire calendar around God by constantly observing holy time. The hope is that by remembering God and what he has done for them in time past they will not disobey like their parents did in time present. 

This section about holy time ends with a brief word about vows (30:2). Like other moments in holy time, vows are also marked off by sacrifices. The one thing that is stressed here is that vows to God must not be broken. 

But then God goes into detail about vows made by a daughter or a wife. A husband can break a vow his wife makes, but he will get the penalty for breaking it (30:15). The husband will bear the wife’s iniquity. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Is this not what Jesus has done for us as our new and better husband? 

We have broken vows to ourselves, one another, and God. Yet, Jesus steps in as our husband and bears the penalty of our vow breaking (1 Pet 2:24). 

As the New Testament says in Colossians, God has canceled our “record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross” (Col. 2:14). When Jesus canceled our record of debt on the cross, he also reoriented our time based on himself and his saving actions. 

In fact, that same passage in Colossians goes on to say that the new moon festivals and Sabbath observances were “a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ” (Col. 2:17). It is Jesus’ sacrifice that we remember each day that makes our whole lives a holy time. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will give you eyes to see the God who gives us endless ways to order ourselves around him in space and in time. And that you will see Jesus and his sacrifice as the one event that we can remember every day that will change the entire orientation of our lives."

The Israelite camp has been arranged around the tabernacle. But now, instead of arranging people around the tent, God starts telling people to leave the proximity of the tent. That is because only the ritually clean can maintain this proximity to God’s presence. But how is this cleanliness maintained? 

Well, a lot of that was already handled in Exodus and Leviticus. But here, we see four areas of laws in which purity is addressed: unclean people, sin restitution, marital fidelity, and individual vows.

We’ll look at all four. 

First, as we’ve already pointed out, the unclean which Leviticus identifies are told to leave the camp (5:2). 

Second, God reminds Israel of the guilt offering (5:6-7). When someone realizes they are guilty of sin, they must offer a sacrifice and add a fifth to it to repay the offended party. 

Third, is a test of adultery in which an accused wife drinks a cup of water with a little dust from the tabernacle’s floor in it (5:17). If she gets sick, that is God’s way of revealing her unfaithfulness. If she has been faithful, she will be unaffected (5:19). Water and dust don’t make you sick. If someone got sick from this mixture, it was a miraculous judgment from God. 

The point is this: God knows the hidden secrets of our hearts and holds us accountable for them.

Lastly, was the Nazarite Vow. If someone wanted to further separate themselves for God, they could take this voluntary vow for a period of time (6:2). In that time there were several lifestyle restrictions they had to live by. 

The reason for all of these laws is the same: the camp must be kept pure. The reason for this is given clearly at the beginning of this whole section: the camp must not be defiled because God dwells in the camp (5:3). 

Two things are at stake when the camp in which God dwells becomes impure. First, God drives out any impurity that comes near him like light drives out darkness. The people will be punished if they approach God in the wrong way. The second thing at stake is God’s presence itself. If the place of God’s dwelling becomes unholy it can no longer be God’s dwelling. He may leave. 

So for Israel’s safety and their nearness to God, the camp must remain holy. 

Where is the Gospel? 

What about us? How do we remain holy today? How can we maintain our proximity to God’s presence through our sin? 

The only answer is that Jesus has accomplished everything discussed here in Numbers. 

Like the unclean cast out of the camp, Jesus took our uncleanliness outside the camp when he died on the cross. 

Like the guilt offering, Jesus made the payment of restitution for all our sins which we could have never afforded.  

Like the test for adultery, we were unfaithful to our God, but Jesus, our husband, drank the bitter cup of God’s wrath instead of us.

Like the Nazarite vow, Jesus has kept every requirement for us so that we might be set apart and holy to the Lord. 

Jesus makes us pure, keeps us holy, and allows us to both be protected from the wrath we deserve and draw near to the presence of God. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see just how pure and holy God is, and that you would see that Jesus is the only one who could make us pure enough to live in his awesome presence."

Israel is setting out from Mt. Sinai and is headed toward the Promised Land. But right away, they sin. 

The people complain against God (11:1). God gets angry with them and a fire breaks out around the outskirts of the camp. The people plead with Moses to do something, so Moses prays and the fire stops (11:2). 

That’s the cycle we’ll see again and again throughout Numbers. The people receive commands, they disobey, God punishes, and someone intercedes. In fact, this cycle will happen three times in just these two chapters - twice with the people and once with the leadership. 

But there is something else happening in this story we need to notice. Moses is overwhelmed that he asks God to just kill him (11:15). But God has other plans. 

God has Moses raise up 70 leaders and then fills them with 70 people with a portion of the Holy Spirit that is in Moses (11:17). When this happens, the 70 leaders immediately start prophesying. But only that one time.

However, elsewhere in the camp, God gave two men, Eldad and Medad, the Spirit as well. And they continued to prophecy (11:26). When people complained about this to Moses, Moses responded by saying that he wished all the Lord’s people would receive the Holy Spirit and prophecy. 

Where is the Gospel? 

What’s amazing is that Moses’ wish actually comes true. 

After Jesus’ ascension, the Holy Spirit comes to the first Christians (Acts 2:4). They share the Gospel through the power of the Holy Spirit. As people come to believe in Jesus the Holy Spirit comes to them as well. And when he does they manifest signs, like prophecy,  just like the 70 leaders did (Acts 19:6). 

But their gift didn’t stop. It kept going like Eldad and Medad. One of Jesus’ closest followers, Peter, said that the Holy Spirit would come to everyone who believes and young and old, slave and free, everyone would have dreams, visions, and would prophesy, just as Moses wished (Acts 2:17). 

It’s no wonder why the apostle Paul echoed Moses’ wish in his first letter to the Corinthians when he said that he wished everyone would prophesy (1 Cor 14:5). 

While, today, prophecy is misunderstood and debated, I believe all Christians can agree on the main point. 

A prophecy is sharing with another something God has revealed. And the greatest thing God has ever revealed is the fullness of who he is in Jesus. The Holy Spirit has come to everyone who believes in Jesus and revealed to them who he is (1 Cor 2:10). 

The good news here is that, because Jesus has ransomed us through his death and filled us with his Holy Spirit, we can break the cycle of sin we read about here in Numbers. We can stop walking according to the flesh, and start walking according to the Spirit (Rom. 8:9). And by doing so, our lives and lips can prophesy the name of Jesus.  

See for Yourself 

I pray that this Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who punishes evil but provides intercession. And that this same Holy Spirit would reveal to you a fuller picture of Jesus, who obeys for you, was punished for you and intercedes for you."

Chapter 33 begins with a travelogue. It traces Israel’s journey from slavery in Egypt, through the wilderness, and to the bank of the Jordan where they about to enter the Promised Land (33:1). 

Recounting Israel’s travel shows that God is faithful to bring his people where he promised, no matter what stood in the way. He promised to bring them out of Egypt and to the Promised Land, and he has done it! 

After the travelogue, God gives three sets of instructions. All of them have to do with Israel’s imminent entry into the land. He tells them to drive out the inhabitants, outlines the boundaries of the nation, and sets leaders who will help divvy up the territory for each tribe. 

If Israel doesn’t drive out the inhabitants God says the natives will become like barbs in their eyes and thorns in their side (33:52). Not only that, but God himself says that he will treat Israel like they were supposed to treat the inhabitants if they don’t drive them out. 

However, as we learn through the rest of the Bible, Israel did not obey God on this very point. They did not completely drive out the inhabitants (Ps 106:34). And so the next two sets of instruction also get broken. They don’t fill the whole land (Josh 13:1) and instead of dividing the land equally, the land gets hoarded by the rich at the sake of the poor (Amos 1:13). 

Ultimately, God’s warning comes true. The Israelites will be driven from the land. They will fail to be the final recipients of the Promised Land. 

That is because the full and final promise was for something in the future. Something better than a plot of land (Heb 11:10). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus gave us a picture of what this promise would be in some of his last words on earth. Instead of telling people outside Israel to go into it, he tells people in Israel to go outside of it (Acts 1:8). He tells his disciples to go to Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth with the good news of what he has done. That’s the church’s travelogue. 

Instead of taking one geographic place by force, Jesus is leading his people everywhere to reach every geographic place with grace (Mat 28:19).

And the climax of this new and better travelogue will be the day when Jesus returns and literally fills the earth with his glory, recreates all things, and brings heaven to earth to dwell with us forever (Ezek 37:27). 

In that land, there will be no boundary line he fails to conquer. There will be no bit of evil he does not drive out and no bit of equity and justice he does not uphold. That’s our new and better Promised Land. And we are on the banks of a metaphorical Jordan, waiting to enter. God’s promise is sure. He is faithful. He will complete this journey. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will give you eyes to see the God who faithfully guides his people. And that you would see Jesus as the one who sends us out to cover the world with his glory and is coming again to do it fully and finally."

It is God’s plan to cover the world in his glory, restore all things, and dwell with his pure people in the new heavens and new earth. In order to do that sin will have to be conquered.

And unlike the old generation, who constantly disobeyed God’s commands and were fearful to enter into combat with other nations, this younger generation obeys. And they do it with only a fraction of their army’s size - only 12,000 people out of over half a million (31:4). 

That’s not the only contrast between the old and new generations we see here. Because of the old generation’s faithlessness, they all died in the wilderness, but not one of the 12,000 men from the new generation who faithfully obeyed God died - even in battle. They all lived. 

Apparently, this new generation was going to be different. Where the first group failed this second group will succeed. 

The next story illustrates the same point. 

The two tribes of Reuben and Gad ask Moses if they can take the land that was conquered back in chapter 21, instead of entering into the Promised Land on the other side of the Jordan River (32:5). Moses gets angry. Surely he thinks these people are about to make the same mistake as the last generation who refused to enter the land (32:6). 

But that’s not the case. These two tribes are willing to enter the land and fight, and afterwards, they will return and live in this land. Moses agrees to these terms and names the land as theirs.

Where is the Gospel? 

Like the Moabites and Midianites in this story, we sin and worship our self-made Idols and need to be driven out of God’s land (Eph 2:12). The good news of the Gospel is that Jesus has already waged and won the full war with sin and death for us in his death, burial, and resurrection. The holy war against sin that should have been waged against us has fallen on Jesus.

He fought the battle for our reward. He’s like Gad and Reuben, who were willing to go fight for a land they would not possess, but earned the inheritance for someone else (Rom 8:17). Jesus fought our battle against sin and death and grants us the inheritance he earned. 

See for Yourself 

I pray the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who drives out sin to create a holy place for him to dwell with his people. And that you would see Jesus as the one who has fought the battle for us and will return to cover the world with his glory."

Israel’s census is complete. The counted men will march into the Promised Land and drive out the evil inhabitants. 

But before they leave God gives them instructions on how to physically organize themselves as a community. 

The first thing we notice is that all the tribes of Israel are counted for battle except the tribe of Levi. That is because they are supposed to take care of the tabernacle (1:50). As Israel travels, the Levites tend to the tabernacle’s furnishings, break down the tent, and set it back up again. 

The Levites also guard the temple, standing between the people’s sin and God’s holiness. This protected God’s space from being polluted, and unclean people from being punished (1:53).  

In this layout, God was at the center. Surrounding the tent were the Levites. And around the Levites were the 12 tribes of Israel (2:2). 

God explains that the 12 tribes will split up into 4 groups of 3 and position themselves to the north, south, east, and west of the tabernacle - 3 tribes in each direction. Everything is centered around God’s dwelling place in the tent. 

The most surprising and significant detail for us to notice is the position of the tribe of Judah (2:3). Judah is listed first, in the arrangement of the camp, instead of Reuben who was the firstborn. More importantly, though, Judah is placed on the east side of the tent. This is important because the east side of the tent is where the opening was. Judah was given the position closest to the doorway to God’s presence.  

Where is the Gospel?

 

Why is this important? It is important because Judah was Jesus’ tribe (Rev 5:5). He is the reason why Judah was blessed because from them would come our savior. 

But Jesus did not just lead the charge outward by the door of the tabernacle like Judah. Jesus led the charge into the door of the tabernacle. At his death, he earned access into God’s presence for everyone, no matter who you are or where you’re from (Mat 27:51). 

Further, Jesus is the fulfillment of the Levites surrounding the tent. Through his spirit being in us, we carry God’s presence with us everywhere as the Levites did with the tent. 

The Levites, acting as guards, kept people from God’s presence. Jesus, however, acting as savior, invites us in (Heb 4:16). The Levites formed a protective ring around the tabernacle so that they may be no wrath on the people. Jesus bore our wrath on the cross so that we might enter through his protective ring and commune with God. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who would place himself in the center of his people and that you would see Jesus as the descendant of Judah and new and better priest who brings us into God’s very presence."

This is the climactic center of the whole book. Strangely, neither Moses, Aaron, or any member of Israel plays an active role in it. Instead, the main focus is on a prophet for hire, a famous pagan seer named Balaam. 

At this point, Israel has set up camp outside Moab which shared a border with the Promised Land (22:1).

The king of Moab is terrified by Israel’s track record. They broke out of Egypt and have steadily been conquering cities on their way to his border. So he hires this prophet Balaam to curse Israel. If he can’t beat them in physical battle, maybe a spiritual curse will give him the upper-hand he needs to succeed (22:6). 

The king makes an unwittingly ironic request of Balaam. If the prophet curses Israel, he believes they will be cursed. The request is ironic because this is the promise God gave to Abraham and his children. Whoever blesses them will be blessed, and whoever curses them will be cursed (Gen 12:3). They were blessed, and there was nothing anyone could do to change it (23:20).   

But every time Balaam tries to curse Israel, God puts a word in Balaam’s mouth that makes it so Balaam can only bless Israel and never curse them (23:8). No matter the king’s bribes or threat of violence, Balaam blesses Israel again and again. 

Balaam’s prophetic blessing from God includes a restatement of God’s promises. Israel will be an uncountable people (23:10). Israel will conquer her enemies and inherit the land (24:8). 

But one promise stands above them all. This promise comes apart from Balaam searching omens and performing other pagan rituals. This one comes when he was filled with the Holy Spirit. 

He gets a vision of God himself coming down from heaven to make good on his promises and conquer his enemies (24:16). But this vision, he says, is far off (24:17). It won’t happen immediately. And somehow this God who comes down won’t come from the clouds but from Israel herself (24:17)

All Israel’s hope is tied up in this God-man who will come from Israel.

Where is the Gospel? 

This deliverer is none other than Jesus. He is the one from the line of Jacob whom Balaam described as a king, calling him a star and a rod (Rev 2:27-28). 

Sometimes without us knowing there are forces trying to curse us and put us to an end. But because Jesus has come to us, because Jesus has already won the battle with the true enemies of sin and death, and because Jesus is returning to bring us into the final Promised Land, no enemy can thwart us. 

If Jesus calls us blessed no one and nothing can make us cursed (Rom. 8:31). Not our sin or our failure, not a family member, king, or religious figure. Whoever Jesus blesses is blessed. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes like he did to Balaam so that you can see the God who has blessed us richly in Jesus Christ."

Israel is in chaos. Both the Levites and the 12 tribes have rebelled, resulting in 250 dead in front of the tabernacle and 14,700 dead in the camp. 

The people are beginning to feel the reality of what it means to live near the one, true, holy God as sinners. Listen to their collective cry recorded in 17:13, “Everyone who comes near the tabernacle of the Lord shall die. Are we all to perish?” 

In order for God to continue to live among his people, there would need to be a buffer between the people with their sin and God with his holiness. That is what the priests were for.  

God publicly confirms Aaron, his sons, and his tribe of Levites as the one group of representatives he had chosen to work around and in the tabernacle of his presence (17:5). He does this by miraculously causing Aaron’s staff to sprout flowers while the staffs of the other 12 tribe leaders remained lifeless (17:8). 

God is reaffirming his commitment to the Levites, which would be sorely needed after so much rebellion and death. 

Something else that would be needed after all this death is a way to clean up the camp from all the dead bodies. But they can’t touch the dead bodies without becoming unclean (19:11). 

So God provides a solution. A red cow was taken outside the city and sacrificed as a sin offering (19:2). The ashes from this heifer were mixed with water to create a cleansing solution. This mixture could be sprinkled on people and their houses to purify them after coming in contact with death (19:12).

Where is the Gospel?  

God chose Aaron as his mediator. The proof was in the sprouting of a bud from a lifeless staff. But God ultimately chose Jesus as the final mediator. And the proof was the sprouting of his body from the lifeless grave (Acts 17:31). 

We now have a full and final answer to the question Israel asked in the passage. Everyone who draws near to God dies. Are we all to perish? The answer is now an emphatic, “No!” to anyone and everyone who would put their confidence in what Jesus has done for them on the cross (Heb 4:16). 

Like the mixture of water and the heifer’s ashes, the New Testament tells us that when we believe in Jesus we are sprinkled with the blood of our final sin offering - Christ himself (Heb 10:22). 

This not only removes the uncleanliness of death like the heifer; it removes death itself. Those who have been sprinkled with this new and better solution will be risen as Christ was risen (Rom 8:11). They will sprout up in resurrection from the grave just as Jesus did. They will beat death because of the Gospel.

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will give you eyes to see the God who appoints mediators to act on our behalf, and that you would see Jesus as the final and eternal mediator who allows us to forever live in God’s presence without fear of death."

The people of Israel have arrived at the land God promised them - the land of Canaan. God had told them the land would be occupied, but that he would be with them to conquer and drive out those who lived there (13:1). 

12 leads are sent to check out the land. But some of the occupants were giants, descendants of the part divine, part human Nephilim from Genesis (Gen 6:4). 

10 of the spies were afraid and spread their fear around the camp. Only 2 of the spied, Caleb and Joshua, believed that God would be with them to take the land no matter what. 

In familiar fashion, the Israelites sided with faithlessness and disobedience. They complained, wishing they were back in Egypt or even regretting that they didn’t just die out in the wilderness (14:2). 

So God punishes the generation of all those 20 years old and up, which was the generation counted in the census at the beginning of Numbers. They would get what they asked for. They would wander the wilderness for 40 years until every last member of that generation was dead (14:22-23). 

Then God would bring the younger generation back to the Promised Land and allow them to inhabit it. 

When this news came to the people they mourned and tried to make up for it. A huge group of them presumptuously went into the land of Canaan to try and fight the occupants. But since God was not with them, they lost terribly (14:42). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The book of Hebrews tells us that these people had Good News proclaimed to them (Heb 4:2). The Good News was that God would be with them to bring them into his rest at the Promised Land. 

But they did not believe this Good News. That is why they were kept from entering God’s rest in the Promised Land. 

The book of Hebrews takes it a step further by saying the true and final rest God offers remains today (Heb 4:9). And this rest is only available through Jesus. 

Jesus has already defeated our true enemy of sin on the cross. Jesus has already conquered the true giant of death in his resurrection. He has already entered into the final Promise Land at the right hand of God, where he sits and rests from his perfectly accomplished work (Heb 10:12). All we must do is have faith like the Israelites failed to do. 

Both this text in Numbers and in Hebrews offer us the same warning. Don’t lose faith (Heb 4:7). Believe the Gospel. Trust that God is powerful enough to save you. Believe that Jesus has earned what you couldn’t earn yourself. 

Don’t be like the presumptions Israelites who tried to enter into the land without God and lost. You can’t earn this yourself. Trust and rest.

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to the God who goes before you into the Promised Land, and that you would see Jesus as the one who fully and finally defeated the giants of sin and death to bring us to himself."

The book of Numbers closes with God giving commands to the people before they cross the Jordan and enter the Promised Land.

At the beginning of Numbers, God positioned the Levites around the tabernacle to provide a holy buffer for the people of God and blatantly mark off the area around the tent as sacred space.

But when the people go into the land, they will be spread out. So God commands every tribe to provide the Levites a patch of land for their livestock on every side of certain allotted cities (35:4).

The Levites are to continue their role as the holy buffer around the tribes, as well as the ones who blatantly display the fact that all the Promised Land is now sacred space.

The second command God gives is about punishing a murderer. Blood from a murdered person defiles the land and that defilement must be atoned for. The only way to atone for it is by the shed blood of the murderer (35:33).

However, for deaths resulting from accidents, the person who caused the accident can flee to a city of refuge and be safe from the victim’s closest relative, called the avenger of blood.

The last command God gives which closes the book of Numbers is about how marriage affects land inheritance (36:3). Land must not be transferred from one tribe to another based on marriage. To help enforce this rule, the people are instructed to marry within their own tribe so that this never even becomes an issue (36:6).

This may seem like a strange way to end a book. But it points to the certainty of Israel possessing the land. It also reminds Israel that the land is God’s and that God will live with them in the land.

Where is the Gospel?

But it also points to several ways the Gospel escalates and fulfills these commands.

Like the Levites in their allocated cities, Christians act as priests in every city they live in. With the Holy Spirit in us we turn regular space into sacred space everywhere we go (2 Cor. 5:20).

This will ultimately be fulfilled in Jesus when he returns and fills the whole earth with his presence (Hab 2:14). There will be no need for stand-ins and visible reminders, for Jesus himself will be ever-present.

Consider also the cities of refuge. God is the avenger of blood who can exercise his right to put us to death. However, he provides us with a city of refuge in Jesus.

Jesus fulfills the laws about marriage and land as well. Because we are married to Jesus through faith, we will inherit the whole earth with him when he returns (Rev 21:2).

See For Yourself

I pray the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who wants to live among us no matter what hurdles have to be overcome. And that you would see Jesus as the one who finally accomplishes everything necessary to bring us into that promised inheritance with him."

God has placed Israel in a formation around the tabernacle. The Levites in the center and the other 12 tribes around them on each side.

In this passage, we learn the specific jobs given to each clan within the Levites when it comes to moving the tabernacle from place to place (3:6-8). Some carried furnishings, others fabric, and still others tended the tent pegs and pillars. 

Finally, there was Moses and Aaron - the high priest. They camped at the entrance of the tent on the East and oversaw all the other clans and their operations. 

But in the midst of all this detail, something remarkable happens. 

God says that all firstborn males belong to him. This is based on what he did in Exodus. He put to death all the Egyptian firstborn males but passed over all the Israelites’ firstborn (Ex 12:29). Basically, the firstborn owe their lives to God. They belong to him. 

But, instead of taking each firstborn from all the tribes into his service, God allows the Levites to stand in for them as their substitute (3:41). 

So another census is taken to count the firstborn males in Israel (3:42). 

There are 22,273 firstborn males in Israel. And 22,000 Levite males. That means that all firstborn males have a one for one substitute except for 273 of them. What are the rest to do? They are bought at a price of 5 shekels each (3:47-48). Basically, the price on their head is paid. 

Now, instead of all the firstborn males from every tribe being taken out of their families and land to serve in God’s tent, the Levites perform this duty on their behalf. 

Where is the Gospel? 

This is a picture of how Jesus is our substitute. 

We have a price on our heads. Because of our sin, we deserve what the firstborn Egyptians got - death (Rom 6:23). But God’s wrath passes over us when we put our faith in Jesus who received the penalty we deserved as our substitute (Mark 10:45)). But when Jesus paid for the death we deserved with his life, there was no remainder left unpaid like the 273 Israelites who had to be bought with money. Jesus paid it all.

Moreover, Jesus has performed every tabernacle task that we never could have performed. His own body is the true tabernacle where God dwelt on earth (John 1:14). In our place, he did not pull up some tent pegs and fold some cloth, he allowed the tent of his body to literally be torn down. But the tent didn’t stay down. God also set the tent of his body back up in his resurrection.  

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who allows substitutes to take our place, and that you would see Jesus as the one for one substitute that performed the deeds we could never perform and who took the penalty we truly deserved."

And he empowers us to show mercy towards those who doubt the reality of God's judgment.",Website,Jude Bible Study,"What's Happening?

Jude, the brother of Jesus, responds to a theological crisis and calls his people to fight for the faith passed down to them (Jude 1, 3). False teachers claim that God's grace has canceled his moral commands. They say it's God's job to forgive, so Jesus is no longer a moral Master or Authority of their lives (Jude 4). The false teaching says that as humans we are free to pursue our passions, particularly sexual ones, because we are the masters of our bodies and God will forgive us anyway.

So Jude reminds his readers of several stories from the Hebrew Bible where God exercises his moral authority by judging those who dismiss his authority. In the Exodus, God saved Israel from slavery but judged the Israelites who did not believe God was in charge (Jude 5). Before the Flood, a group of angelic beings disregarded God's authority, slept with human women, and were judged for crossing that divine boundary (Jude 6; Genesis 6:2). In Sodom and Gomorrah the opposite happened, but with the same effect. A group of men wanted to rape angelic beings and were punished for it (Jude 7). To Jude, these false teachers are just new incarnations of an ancient hostility towards God's moral authority (Jude 8).

Jude then borrows from a piece of popular literature that adapted the story of Moses' burial from the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 34:5-6). In the popular version, the Devil claims to the archangel Michael that Moses' body belongs to him because Moses murdered a man. Michael, instead of accusing the devil of slander, holds his tongue and says in effect, ""I leave judgment, in this case, up to God"" (Jude 9). Jude's point is that even in their popular literature all the heavenly beings admit God is Master and Judge.

These false teachers are ignorant of reality. And in their ignorance they've become animals ruled by whatever their hearts desire (Jude 10). Like Cain who murdered his brother in envy, like Balaam who sold out Israel in greed, and like Korah who committed treason to gain power, these false teachers, baited by their lusts, invite judgment (Jude 11).

Jude warns the faithful that these shipwrecked souls are now like hidden reefsÑboth dangerous and inviting death to anyone who gets too close (Jude 12). Like a comet loosed from orbit, the end of their autonomy and cheap grace is eternal darkness (Jude 13). Quoting from the then-popular book of Enoch, Jude warns that God is coming to bring conviction and justice against all who reject God's authority and take advantage of his grace (Jude 15-16).

Where is the Gospel?

False teachers are nothing new and shouldn't surprise us (Jude 17-18). False teachers have always tried to snatch and divide God's people (Jude 19). But the good news is that in a world of deceptive teachers, Jesus keeps us for himself (Jude 1). In a world that lures us to follow our hearts and instincts, Jesus keeps us from being trapped by that ancient hostility (Jude 24). And instead of becoming enslaved to our instincts, Jesus our Master frees us to persevere in mercy and love like he did on the cross.

Jesus has kept us for himself, mercifully snatching us from the fire. And he empowers us to show mercy towards those who doubt the reality of God's judgment (Jude 22). God does not desire that any would die, and so he makes us ministers of preservation to snatch other doubting souls from the flames (Jude 23). Perhaps you doubt God's moral authority as you watch this. If so, let this video warn you that God's judgment is coming. But if you accept that warning, know that the Moral Master of the Universe will use all of his authority to save you from the judgment you've rejected. He will free you from your appetites and make you truly human and righteous forever.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has all glory, majesty, dominion, and authority forever. And may you see Jesus as the One who is able to keep you and present you blameless before God."

In this passage, the apostle Paul insists that badges of Jewish identity are not necessary to become members of God’s family.",Website,Galatians Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

A group of teachers have begun to publicly contradict the message of the apostle Paul (Galatians 1:6-7). Paul taught that trusting Jesus’ life and death was the only prerequisite for becoming a member of God’s family. But they taught that faith in Jesus was only the first in a two-step process. The second step was to accept the identifying marks of God’s historic family, the Jews, such as observing the sabbath, keeping Jewish feasts, eating kosher, and circumcision (Galatians 5:2-3). They also claimed that the only reason Paul shied away from these biblical commands was to make his message more palatable to his non-Jewish audience (Galatians 1:10). The letter of Galatians is Paul’s response to these arguments.

Paul begins by saying his message comes straight from God and has not been modified by his time ministering to non-Jews (Galatians 1:11-12). Jesus himself, after rising from the dead, appointed Paul to be a messenger of the good news that Jesus gave himself to rescue us from the evils of this age and make us part of his family (Galatians 1:1-5). Paul is insistent. Badges of Jewish identity are not necessary to become members of God’s family. This message is straight from God and there is no other Gospel (Galatians 1:8-9).

Ever since God rescued him, Paul has zealously preached this Gospel. He is so confident in the divine origin of his message that he didn’t even consult the other apostles (Galatians 1:15-17). Once he did, three years later, they affirmed that Paul’s message was consistent with theirs (Galatians 1:18-24). And 11 years later when Paul formally brought his ministry under their review, they neither added to his understanding of the Gospel nor demanded the circumcision of his Greek ministry partner (Galatians 2:1-6). Rather, they confirmed that Paul’s message to non-Jews was the same as their message to Jews (Galatians 2:7-10); namely, that entrance into God’s family isn’t dependent on Jewish markers of identity, but faith in Jesus alone (Galatians 2:16).

Paul even confronted the apostles when they failed to live consistently with this position. Once, the apostle Peter refused to share a family meal with a group of non-Jews, concerned that those who demand circumcision would be offended (Galatians 2:11-13). But Paul called him out. To refuse to eat with non-Jews is to suggest that non-Jews must first act like Jews if they want to be a part of their family meals (Galatians 2:14). While even the apostles were tempted to soften Jesus’ message, Paul did not. If the Galatians are going to trust anybody, it should be Paul. He consistently refused to modify the good news of Jesus.

Where is the Gospel?

Both Peter and Paul know that becoming a member of God’s family is not dependent on observing Jewish laws, but faith in Jesus alone (Galatians 2:15-16). It is wrong for Jews who believe in Jesus to separate from non-Jews for failing to accept their markers of Jewish identity. That is to deny that Jesus has unified all people through his life and death without regard for their ethnicity (Galatians 2:17-19).

Trust in Jesus, and not in performing certain markers of Jewish identity, is what makes us part of God’s family (Galatians 2:20). The ones breaking God’s laws aren’t uncircumcised people, but those who insist on circumcision and other markers of belonging (Galatians 2:18). To add a performative element to faith in Jesus is to make Jesus’ death meaningless (Galatians 2:20-21).

Jesus died so we can live as members of his united family forever. He ended an old era marked by its ethnic distinctions and replaced it with a new age marked by faith (Galatians 1:4; 5:6). Every era of God’s people will face the temptation to create new divisions. There will always be people who settle for a false Gospel that makes good guys and bad guys out of which day you worship, which foods you eat, or even who you vote for. But the good news is that trusting Jesus is enough. In him, we have died to this era’s divisions. And by faith in him, all people have been united into his family, killing those old hostilities and replacing them with sacrificial love for all people.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has given us only one Gospel. And may you see Jesus as the only one you need to trust."

Since the beginning of time, there have been two families: the family of God and the family of Satan. And since Satan tricked Eve and then Cain killed Abel, these two families have been at war.

John says his people are “born of God,” are “children of God,” and even the “seed of God” (1 John 2:29; 3:1, 9). At the same time, their enemies are “children of the devil'' (1 John 3:10). And they act like it. Their malice proves they’re spiritual descendants of the one who “has been sinning since the beginning” (1 John 3:8b). Those born of the Devil are committed to the same “lawlessness” that Satan used to convince Eve (1 John 3:4) and motivate Cain to kill his brother (1 John 3:12). But those born of God make a habit of practicing righteousness and saying “no” to sin (1 John 3:7).

Even though those “of the devil” have hunted and murdered the children of God since the beginning of history, John’s community doesn’t need to be surprised, alarmed, or stop loving one another (1 John 3:13). As Genesis promised, Jesus has come to destroy the enemy’s plans (1 John 3:8c; Genesis 3:16). John’s church is free to love their brothers and sisters despite the cost because they know even death leads to resurrection (1 John 3:16).

Where is the Gospel?

In the face of severe persecution John wants his disciples to be assured that God is on their side. So John takes their suffering and makes it bigger. He blows it up to cosmic proportions and helps his community see that God is already in the middle of the war they’re fighting—and winning. God has already sent his Son to take away lawlessness (1 John 3:5). Jesus has already destroyed the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). And like he promised Adam and Eve, he has crushed the snake (Genesis 3:15). So if they abide in Jesus, they will never be shamed by their allegiance to him (1 John 2:28). They can be confident, even in death, that their home is with him forever.

And John also helps his community see just how thoroughly God has transformed them. They are not like Cain plotting murder (1 John 3:6). They are members of a new family. Like children reborn, sin is no longer the defining pattern of their life—righteousness is (1 John 3:10). And their love towards each other proves they’ve passed from death to life and are included in Jesus’ victory over evil and the grave (1 John 3:14).

If you’ve ever wondered which family you belong to, there is a God who is greater than your doubting heart (1 John 3:20). He died to defeat evil and has risen to encourage us in death. And he has filled and transformed us by his Spirit (1 John 3:24). We don’t need to guess which family we belong to anymore. God has seen the suffering of his family and come to rescue us! And when we trust Jesus and love one another we can know we’re on the right side of the war.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has made us his children. And may you see Jesus as the one who has defeated the works of the evil one."

The word “love” is used 27 times in 1 John, not counting when John calls his community “beloved.” That’s because love is intrinsic to God's nature; God is love (1 John 4:8). God is the definition of love. And God has further defined love as Jesus dying so that we can live (1 John 4:9). Love is not defined as our love for God but as Jesus’ sacrificial death to cover our sins (1 John 4:10).

And if we accept that redemptive love, we become children of God (1 John 3:1). Children always carry the characteristics of their Father. Jesus demonstrates this family resemblance by revealing his Father’s love—and so must we. All children of God must carry the defining mark of loving brothers, sisters, and even enemies (1 John 4:21).

John uses the term “antichrists” for people opposed to Jesus and his family (1 John 3:10). And the tell-tale sign of an antichrist is hatred (1 John 4:20). But antichrists are hateful not because they’re uncharitable and violent (although they often are), but because antichrists deny the revelation of “God-Is-Love” in Jesus (1 John 2:22). Antichrists can be either cruel and violent or kind and inclusive. What defines an antichrist is that he or she is against Jesus’ sacrificial death for our sins, and so against God’s definition of love.

Where is the Gospel?

By denying Jesus’ death, the antichrists have eroded the confidence John’s community has in God’s love for them. But John wants his disciples to be confident that God loves them. God’s love is a matter of history. God’s love has died in the past and been raised forever. God has loved us first, and continues to do so (1 John 4:19). We don’t need to be unsure of God’s love for us because God’s love is defined and demonstrated on the cross. We have no reason to be afraid inside of God’s love (1 John 4:18)!

John says that fear has to do with punishment. We’re afraid we’re not enough and that God will reject us for it (1 John 4:17). But God knew all about our sin, lack of love, and hatred when he died on the cross. In perfect love Jesus died fully aware of what he was paying for.So there’s no reason for you to be afraid inside that type of unconditional love.

God shows the world the definition of love by giving us his Son. And now, like our Father and Brother, we can show the world God’s love by loving those around us (1 John 4:21). That begins by proclaiming that God has come and died in Jesus, and is perfected when we love as Jesus loved. But in the same way that it’s possible to fear God doesn’t love us, it’s also possible to fear not loving others well enough.

But John says we know we love one another because we love God and keep his commandments (1 John 5:2). The love we have for God and for his sacrificial death, necessarily bleeds over and transforms our love towards one another. The work of loving others isn’t another reason to be afraid we’re missing the mark, but celebratory proof that we are God’s children (1 John 5:2). The good news is that the world, its hate, and its antichrists are passing away. The good news is that love brings confidence and casts out fear because in love Jesus has come, died, and overcome the world (1 John 5:5).

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is love. And may you see Jesus as your atoning sacrifice who demonstrates and defines love—and by his resurrection overcomes the world."

John wants everybody who reads his letter to know they have eternal life in Jesus—and specifically life in Jesus’ bloody death (1 John 5:13). But this is offensive to several false teachers. They claim they’re eyewitnesses to a more “spiritual gospel” that doesn’t include Jesus’ coming in the flesh or his bloody death. In denying that Jesus came in flesh and blood, the false teachers deny there is eternal life in Jesus, and they’re calling God a liar (1 John 5:10).

But John says his Gospel has more reliable eyewitnesses (1 John 5:9). John’s Gospel is attested to by the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and empty tomb. The testimony Jesus proclaims isn’t speculative or spiritual but actual life from the physically dead in him (1 John 5:11). That’s why, John says, Jesus came by both water and blood (1 John 5:6). They’re references to Jesus’ two baptisms: the baptism at the beginning of his ministry when the Holy Spirit landed on him like a dove and God testified that Jesus is his Son, and the baptism of blood Jesus went under on the cross where he killed our sin and God raised him the dead (Mark 10:38). Contrary to the testimony of the false teachers, the testimony of Jesus’ baptism, his death, and the Holy Spirit proclaim that God has come in a body, died a bloody death, and rose (1 John 5:7-8). And the same Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, now lives in us and secures eternal life with God forever.

Where is the Gospel?

John wants everybody who reads his letter to know they have eternal life in Jesus (1 John 5:13).

And more than knowing that our life will extend indefinitely, John wants us to know that our lives will be marked by the power of God. John says if we ask anything according to his will in prayer, God will hear and will give (1 John 5:14-15). Eternal life doesn’t just mean living a long time—eternal life starts now because God lives in us and always hears our prayers.

And John doesn’t hedge his bets when he’s talking about prayer. He doesn’t say God might give what we ask, but that he will. Even our prayers for brothers and sisters who are walking towards death will be answered with the gift of resurrection life (1 John 5:16). Contrary to the false teachers, the God who died is the God of life, and through us he even gives life to others. We pray infused with the life and power of Jesus because, like Jesus, we have been born of God (1 John 5:18).

John ends his letter of encouragement by reminding us of the Truth: Jesus is both the true God and eternal life (1 John 5:20). Only in Jesus’ body is there love that covers our sin, only in Jesus’ bloody death, is there resurrection. All other gospels are inferior, they’re just man-made idols to lesser deities (1 John 5:21). There is only one place to find life and love—and that is in Jesus.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has come by water and blood. And may you see Jesus as the one who is eternal life and love in the flesh."

",Website,"1, 2, & 3 John Bible Study","What’s Happening?

John, Jesus’ disciple, writes to a community under attack from false teachers. John goes so far as to call them “antichrists” (1 John 2:22). These antichrists are pastors or church leaders who have left their churches and now claim that John and the other apostles are wrong about Jesus (1 John 2:19). They claim that Jesus did not come in the flesh (1 John 4:3, 2 John 1:7). They deny that God took on a body and they deny that God—in Jesus—bled on the cross for them.

So John begins his letter by grounding his message in what he heard, saw, and touched (1 John 1:1). John is an eyewitness, alongside the other disciples and apostles. He has firsthand experience with Jesus, with God himself. The antichrists want to spiritualize the Gospel, but John says they can’t spiritualize away his testimony.

John insists that the same God who was from the beginning was born, and the Word of Life became alive and lived in front of him (1 John 1:2). John has seen God with his eyes and heard him with his ears (1 John 1:3a). The antichrists’ spiritualized message is contrary to the facts: God has been born, the apostles have seen, heard, and touched him, and so eternal life is only found in Jesus.

Where is the Gospel?

The antichrists denied the incarnation of Jesus. And as a result, those who listened became plagued by doubts. If God didn’t join himself to humanity, how do humans know they are joined to God? If the incarnation isn’t real, how can we ever know we’re saved?

John’s answer is simple. We have real fellowship with God because God has physically joined himself to humanity (1 John 1:3)! Jesus was real. Eternal life was touched. That which was from the beginning was born to Mary. No one who trusts the good news of Jesus’ incarnation needs to fear where he or she stands with God. God has saved us just as certainly as we’ve been born of our mother.

And while it’s true that we, like John’s community, haven’t seen Jesus with our own eyes, John was an eyewitness. John ate, slept, and walked with Eternal Life in the flesh. John watched Jesus die, and John looked into his empty tomb. The antichrists have no leg to stand on. God coming in the flesh is a matter of history, and all the apostles agree. God has come in the flesh; his name is Jesus. And in him you are saved.

Lies have always been the greatest threat to God’s people, and in John’s second letter he warns a church he affectionately calls his chosen lady and children about them (2 John 1). In many ways it summarizes in one chapter what he spent five chapters explaining in his previous letter. 2 John is an apostolic booster shot to a church in need of care.

Like before, John reminds the church to love one another and keep God’s commands (2 John 5-6). He warns them of deceivers who deny that Jesus came in the flesh (2 John 7). He also emphasizes that those who do not live the way Jesus taught them to live do not have God (2 John 9). The gift of the Father’s power and the Son’s presence is only given to those who abide in the Gospel John preached, and the commands that Jesus prescribed. John calls this the way of living the truth (2 John 1-2).

That’s why it’s imperative that this church not welcome pastors or teachers who reject the Gospel and teach a different way to live (2 John 10). People of the truth should reject lies that are dangerous. Lies have the potential to rob this specially chosen lady and her children of their full reward of God’s truth and eternal life (2 John 8). John also warns that platforming these deceivers in their churches will make them complicit in their deceit and wickedness (2 John 11).

John abruptly ends his letter and hopes, like a caring father, that paper and pen will soon give way to face to face conversation (2 John 12).

Where is the Gospel?

Lies have always been the greatest threat to God’s people. In the garden of Eden it was a lie that convinced God’s first chosen lady, Eve, to abandon fidelity to God and his commands (Genesis 3:4, 13). Like the antichrists in John’s day, the serpent robbed her of the full reward of Eden, made her complicit in the Deceiver’s evil, and forfeited eternal life with God (Genesis 3:23). The temptation to platform false gospels, tolerate false narratives, and entertain deceitful teachers is one of humanity’s original failures. And no matter how far we are removed from the world of Genesis, holding onto the truth in a world of lies is a perennial problem.

But the good news is that the Truth has already and will again win. God promised Eve that the Truth would one day crush the lie of the Deceiver (Genesis 3:15). And on the cross and by his resurrection, Jesus shows that he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:16). It’s no wonder that the defining teaching of these antichrists is to deny that Jesus came in the flesh (2 John 7, 1 John 2:22a). The best tactic the ancient Deceiver and his children have is to deny it ever happened (John 8:44).

It’s telling that the apostle John in the book of Revelation, describes the entire history of God’s people as a conflict between a deceiving dragon and a chosen lady and her children (Revelation 12:1, 4b). And it’s even more telling that God’s people conquer the Deceiver by the blood of Jesus the antichrists deny, and the truthful testimony the deceivers cannot admit (Revelation 12:11).

By his coming and by his cross Jesus has spoken Truth to a world cursed under a lie. And the Truth is we will not surely die, but have eternal life in God alone through Jesus alone (John 3:16). And one day soon when Jesus returns, every lie will be silenced, all temptations will end, and Truth and Life will be all that’s left.

John’s letters are the only books in the Bible to mention a figure called the antichrist (1 John 2:18). And in 1 John he addresses them directly in chapters 2 and 4. In chapter four, John will call this same group of people “false prophets” (1 John 4:1). John is quick to point out that there is not just one, but many antichrists and that antichrists are a normal part of church life. And antichrists share two things in common.

First, they were once a part of John’s church, but have since left (1 John 2:19). Second, they deny that Jesus is the “Christ,” which is a Greek word that means “Anointed One” (1 John 2:22). Throughout Scripture God has anointed many people. King David is one of the most famous examples (1 Samuel 16:13). Being anointed meant God chose, commissioned, and filled someone with his Spirit to save his people. So to deny that Jesus is God’s Anointed One means you are literally “against-christ” and against God’s plans to save his people (1 John 4:2-3).

But these antichrists weren’t just teaching their beliefs, they were killing for them. In John’s Gospel, Jesus warned that people like this would persecute and kill his disciples (John 16:2-3). And John’s community knows this from experience (1 John 3:15). So John encourages them in their confusion and despair with good news.

Where is the Gospel?

The good news is that John’s disciples have been anointed by God, and those who are against God’s anointed have no power (1 John 2:20). John’s disciples don’t need to be afraid of the lies that God’s enemies throw around because the Holy Spirit has filled them with the truth (John 14:16; 1 John 2:21). God has sent his Son in the flesh. Jesus is the Anointed One. And the Anointed One has risen from the dead to save his people. The truth is, those anti- the Anointed One have already been defeated.

Just as John’s disciples, we are filled with that same anointing. Antichrists live in the world, but God’s anointing lives in us (1 John 2:27a). Antichrists might teach and sound convincing to the world outside (1 John 4:5), but we have a better teacher living in us to remind us of what’s true (1 John 2:27b). We don’t need to fear philosophies, arguments, and worldviews that are anti-Jesus because the world and its lies are passing away (1 John 2:17a). Soon, all that will be left is the truth that Jesus passed away but rose as the Anointed One, commissioned by God to save us from death.

As John says: Little children, you are from God and have overcome the antichrists, because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world (1 John 4:4). Even if the antichrists conspire together to kill us, they can’t win. God’s Anointed One died and rose and we have been anointed with that same Spirit (Romans 8:11). Even when we die, Christians win. There is no antichrist that’s ultimately threatening, because Jesus the Christ has risen from the dead and lives in us.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who anointed his Son, Jesus. And may you see Jesus as the Christ who has already defeated the antichrists and all their power.

Being a follower of Jesus means following him into a battle against evil. This battle isn’t a war of weapons, but of desires. Loving God means not loving the world (1 John 2:15). Not loving the world means not loving what the world loves. The world loves to invent and satisfy desires for our body, lusts for our eyes, and pride in our life (1 John 2:16). The world builds systems, economies, cultures, and religions designed to tempt and destroy us. But John says the way to overcome a world of desires is by remembering that this world and those who love it are passing away. But those who obey and love God live forever (1 John 2:17).

And to a people at war, John recites a poem. This poem shepherds and soothes a community under fire from the lies of false teachers and the condemning voice of the evil one. And John assures three different groups of people: children, fathers, and young men.

John often calls his whole community—both men and women—“children” (1 John 2:1, 18, 28). And he reminds them that their sins really are forgiven and they truly know God as Father (1 John 2:12, 13a). Despite their temptations and failures, God has already forgiven them! Then to fathers (or mature believers) he reminds them twice that their age doesn’t disqualify them, but instead brings them near the God of eternity. As they approach death in this world, they know the Eternal One has their lives in his hands (1 John 2:12-13). And finally to the young men, or those who are most active in the battle of living and working in the world, John reminds them twice that they have overcome the evil one (1 John 2:13b, 14b). John’s point is simple. Yes, we are in a battle, but we’re on the winning side.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus has defeated the powers of evil on the cross. By his Spirit we’re strengthened against every temptation. Even when we die we will continue to live with God our Father. We overcome the world, its desires, and the evil one by remembering the Gospel. Because Jesus lives forever, evil is passing away. Because God is our Father, we will live forever with him.

Our battles with the desires of our body and eyes have been dealt a death-blow in Jesus. In love, Jesus has died, covered our sins, and been resurrected. This is the spiritual weapon we need to fight the evil one (Ephesians 6:11). The devil is on his back foot, and we’re armed to the teeth. Whether we are fathers and mothers or young and strong, we are all children of a victorious Father who only sends his daughters and sons into battle once armed with resurrection life. We don’t need to be afraid of the world. We will overcome its temptation. The good news is that the One in us is greater than the one in the world (1 John 4:4).

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is light. And may you see Jesus as the One who has defeated the darkness of the world so that both he and we can live forever."

John says the Gospel of Jesus can be summed up this way: “God is light; in him there is no darkness at all"" (1 John 1:5). Just as light brought life on the first day of creation and light gives life to every green plant, Jesus brings the light and life of God even from the grave (Genesis 1:3). Like the pillar of fire led Israel through dark nights in the wilderness, Jesus guides us by his Spirit (Exodus 13:21). Just as light judges and expels darkness, Jesus judges and expels the devil and his evil (1 John 3:8; Colossians 2:13). And one day, the brightness of God’s light will even swallow up the actual night (Revelation 22:5). The message “God is Light” is the eternal good news of Jesus summed up in three words. 

But John also says the good news that “God is Light,” is a command to be obeyed (1 John 2:7). The command is that we should love one another as Jesus has loved us (1 John 2:10; John 13:34). Like the fire in the wilderness or the sun in the sky, this good news and good command will lead us to life (1 John 2:10). 

But several in John’s community claimed to be members of the light, while hating one another (1 John 1:6). John says this is a contradiction and a self-evident lie. True members of the light, walk in the light (1 John 1:8). People transformed by the good news that “God is Light” will act like it. These liars are so darkened by their self-deception they call their hate loving (1 John 1:9, 11). And while the liars are busy hiding their darkness under the guise of light, Christians freely confess their darkness because they know the light (1 John 1:10). They know that forgiveness has been bought by Jesus' blood and are willing to step towards him (1 John 2:2). John says that those who walk towards the light, even if they sin, are truly God’s people and will be forgiven (1 John 2:3, 6). But those who refuse to admit their darkness and pretend to be in the light, will soon be blinded by the same light they deny (1 John 2:11). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The good news is that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. The light of God has come to us in Jesus. Jesus is the light of the world (John 8:12). And like the fire that led Israel through the wilderness, Jesus’ Spirit always teaches us where to go (John 14:16). Jesus has overcome both our own and the world’s evil by his loving, sacrificial death (1 John 2:2). 

But how do we know we’re in the light? How do we really know that we are in the life of God? John says that assurance comes when we love one another. Love for each other is how we know that we belong to God, and experience the fullness of God’s love and light (1 John 2:5). God’s light was most clearly seen in Jesus’ love on the cross, so it makes sense that we will most clearly experience our assurance as we live and love like Jesus. 

And what’s beautiful is that even when we fail to love, if we confess our sin to God in whom there is no darkness, we can fully expect the light of his forgiveness. Because of Jesus we have an example to follow, but we also have an Advocate before God who has covered our sins, takes away our guilt, and shines the light of his love on all who ask.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is Light. And may you see Jesus as our atoning sacrifice who covers all our sins."

John’s third letter is directed not to a group of churches, or even one church, but to Gaius, a man John deeply loves (3 John 1). Gaius is a faithful Christian whose hospitality is well known (3 John 3-5). Traveling missionaries frequently stayed at Gaius’ house and then told their home churches about his generosity and love (3 John 6). John wants Gaius to keep doing what he’s doing. For John, hospitality towards missionaries is a litmus test of inclusion in God’s Kingdom. And people like Gaius are co-workers—valuable partners in the mission of Jesus (3 John 8).

But not everyone in Gaius’s community is as humble and hospitable as he is. Diotrephes refuses to listen to John and other apostles' calls for hospitality (3 John 9). He resents their authority, slanders their character, and refuses to welcome their missionaries (3 John 10a). Worse still, Diotrephes has some level of authority in Gaius’s church. He both threatens and excommunicates those willing to support John’s missionaries (3 John 10b).

Knowing that Gaius would read his letter to everyone in his church, John tells them to imitate the good they see in Gaius and reject the evil of Diotrephes and men like him (3 John 11). John ends his third letter the same way he ended his last, with the hope of seeing his friends face to face soon (3 John 13-14).

Where is the Gospel?

John has talked about loving one another in every one of his letters. It’s the defining mark of those who know God (1 John 4:7). And the failure to love your brothers and sisters is the defining mark of those who don’t know God (1 John 4:8). Hospitality towards missionaries is a litmus test of inclusion in God’s Kingdom.

When Jesus first sent out his disciples, the hospitality shown by a town towards them determined whether God’s peace or God’s judgment would fall (Matthew 10:13, 15). Near the end of Jesus’ life, he said that whether or not we show hospitality to “the least of these” signals our eternal destiny (Matthew 25:45-46). That’s because hospitality isn’t just serving others—but Jesus himself (Matthew 25:40). To give or withhold hospitality (especially towards those sent to proclaim the way of Jesus) is to accept or deny that Jesus was sent by God.

Fittingly, Jesus revealed himself through his own hospitality. He gave wine to a wedding (John 2:11). He hosted feasts in the desert (Luke 9:16). He offers his body and blood as a meal to be eaten (Matthew 26:26-28). And when he finally convinced his disciples that he rose from the dead, it was over a shared meal (Luke 24:35). Jesus is generous and hospitable to his people. And when his people are hospitable in kind, God shows up. Jesus reveals himself. And we become coworkers and God’s chosen partners in the proclamation of Jesus and his Gospel.

Don’t imitate the evil of Diotrephes. Don’t invite the judgment Jesus warns against. Instead, love your brothers and be hospitable to your sisters, especially those who have been sent, like Jesus, to proclaim good news.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is generous. And may you see Jesus as our hospitable host inviting us to a feast of his generosity and love."

In Jesus, there is no Jew or Gentile.",Website,Galatians Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Paul continues to argue with a group of teachers who believe that faith in Jesus isn’t enough to be part of God’s family. They claim believers must also accept the traditional markers of Jewish identity found in the laws of the Hebrew Bible, particularly circumcision. But Paul says this is foolish in light of their own experience. Some of the Galatians watched Jesus die for them (Galatians 3:1-2). The rest received the Holy Spirit and even saw miracles. And all this happened before any of them were told they needed to be circumcised or eat kosher (Galatians 3:2, 5). Based on their own experience, faith is all they’ve needed to receive the blessing of being in God’s family (Galatians 3:3).

In fact, that’s exactly what the Hebrew Bible teaches. Abraham, the first Jew, was made the patriarch of God’s family by his faith alone (Galatians 3:6; Genesis 15:6). And God promised Abraham that the entire world (both Jewish and otherwise) would be blessed by trusting God as he had (Galatians 3:7-9). Even the book of Deuteronomy, which contains many of the debated identity markers, says no one who trusts in those laws will become a part of God’s family because no one can keep them perfectly (Deuteronomy 27:26; Galatians 3:10). And even the Jewish prophets said the righteous live by faith alone (Habakkuk 2:4; Galatians 3:11). The entire canon of Jewish scripture is unified. Faith saves, not observing a set of laws or bearing the marks of Jewish identity.

Specifically, faith in Jesus saves. When Jesus died he bore a curse on behalf of all who failed to live according to the laws of the Hebrew Bible (Galatians 3:13). It was not so that believers could go back to observing those identity markers more faithfully, but to receive Abraham’s promised blessing—the inclusion of both Jews and non-Jews into God’s family by his grace and our faith alone (Galatians 3:14).

Paul’s rivals believe that insisting on circumcision is the only way to secure membership in God’s family. But Paul argues the opposite is true. God promised Abraham that his descendant, Jesus, would eventually inherit his blessing and give it to the world (Galatians 3:16; Genesis 12:17). That promise was given 430 years before any Jewish law was written. So to insist that a Jewish law is how people secure being part of God’s family actually erases the promise that created God’s family in the first place (Galatians 3:17-18).

This isn’t to say the Jewish laws are at odds with God’s promise to make a united global family; they just can’t create a member of God’s family (Galatians 3:21-22). The Jewish laws were guides, leading people to trust that God’s promise of a global family would come through a future son of Abraham. Circumcision was an embodied demonstration of that faith (Galatians 3:19, 24). Circumcision isn’t at odds with the cross, but a prophecy cut into the bodies of every Jewish male that Jesus is how the world will become part of God’s family.

Where is the Gospel?

God’s law marked the children of Abraham as keepers of God’s promise. The way they ate, the days they worshiped, their calendars, and even their reproductive organs all communicated their trust in the promises of God. But these laws could never create members of God’s family. To become a member of God’s family requires a deeper transformation than a ritual circumcision.

We are transformed into God’s family just as Abraham was—by faith in God’s son. We know him as Jesus (Galatians 3:23-24). Instead of laws written on stones or bodies marked by knives, God marks his new family by transforming their hearts by his Holy Spirit. This is the only way we become members of God’s global family and children of God through faith (Galatians 3:26).

The Jewish markers that pointed to God’s promises have come true in Jesus’ life and death. When we unite ourselves to Jesus we receive the promise God made to Abraham and become members of God’s global family (Galatians 3:27). In Jesus, there is no Jew or Gentile. There are no different gospels for slaves or free men, or different paths of atonement for male or female. We are all one in Jesus and we all stand to inherit the blessing that God intends for his people since Abraham (Galatians 3:28-29).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who makes promises. And may you see Jesus as the promised son of Abraham who welcomes us into God’s family through faith.

The apostle Paul has just established that circumcision was never how God’s people become a part of God’s family (Galatians 3:19, 24). God’s family was created through faith in a coming son of Abraham who would one day unify and bless the world. Circumcision wasn’t a citizenship test but a prophecy cut into the bodies of every Jewish male that Abraham’s son, Jesus, would make all people part of God’s family.

But a group of teachers insist that circumcision and other markers of Jewish identity found in the laws of the Hebrew Bible are still necessary to be part of God’s family. But the apostle Paul says requiring badges of Jewish identity is a kind of slavery (Galatians 5:1). Requiring just a single Hebrew legal requirement actually demands humanity obey all 613 laws recorded in the Bible (Galatians 5:2-4). No Jew has ever been able to do this; it is slavery to an impossible standard, not to mention a complete rejection of Abraham’s hope that his son Jesus would unite the world into God’s family.

It’s not through badges of Jewish identity, but by faith that anyone is made part of God’s family (Galatians 5:5-6). By demanding circumcision, these teachers separate themselves from Jesus just as they have separated the foreskin from their bodies. So Paul says that as a symbol of their separation from God, they might as well go all the way and cut the whole thing off (Galatians 5:12).

But just because the law didn’t make the Galatians part of God’s family, that doesn’t mean they won't follow it. In fact, because of the Holy Spirit, God’s family is finally free to love God and love one another as the Hebrew law intended (Galatians 5:13-14). Previously, the Galatians were enslaved to their sinful, selfish, and self-destructive desires, unable to truly love God or those around them (Galatians 5:19-21). But now the Holy Spirit has filled them with the freedom to deny those desires for the sake of others (Galatians 5:16-17). While the Hebrew law constricted people’s behavior, in Jesus there are no laws restricting the power of the Holy Spirit. God’s people can offer love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control to God and one another without measure (Galatians 5:22-25).

And just because God’s people are free from the law doesn’t mean they won’t be held accountable for their actions. Paul calls the freedom to love others the “law of Jesus'' (Galatians 6:2). This law demands a life of sacrificial love that doesn’t separate from others’ sins and burdens, but helps carry them (Galatians 6:3-5). To refuse to love others this way is to take advantage of the love God showed his people on the cross—and invites judgment (Galatians 6:7-8). In Jesus we are accountable to a new standard where we are not free to do as we like, but are freed to love without limits (Galatians 6:9-10).

Where is the Gospel?

To the apostle Paul, we can’t both be slaves to a set of laws and free to love God and others. Paul insists that we are freed from the necessity of Jewish laws because Jesus has made us part of God’s family by his life and death. But Paul’s rivals feared, just as some do today, that without holding onto the necessity of certain laws they had no way to restrain people’s desires or call others to account.

But on the cross, Jesus crucified and killed this old understanding of both the law and the world (Galatians 6:14). Jesus has made us a totally new kind of family by filling us with his Spirit. This change is so radical, Paul says we are “new creations”—totally and finally free to love God and love others without the need for a tablet of laws carved in stone (Galatians 6:15). God’s law lives in us because Jesus lives in all those who trust in his life, death, and resurrection. Religious accomplishments, purity of behavior, or badges of ethnic or cultural identity do nothing to include or exclude anyone from God’s family. What counts is that Jesus, on his own, has made us new members of his family.

No matter what you’ve been told, there is no standard we must meet before God will accept us. That means we can take pride, not in the religious laws we’ve kept, but in Jesus. He made us a member of God’s family. His Spirit frees us to love God and others without limits. And his death and resurrection means we will live forever in God’s love without limits.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has made us his family. And may you see Jesus as the one who frees us from slavery to the law and invites us to live by the Spirit."

A group of teachers argue that trusting Jesus must be supplemented with markers of Jewish identity recorded in the laws of the Hebrew Bible. But in Paul’s mind this is a diminishment of what Jesus came to do.

To explain, Paul compares God’s relationship with his people to being like a child who is the heir of a large estate (Galatians 4:1). At one point in time all heirs are like slaves. Trustees tell an heir what to do until he matures (Galatians 4:2). But once a child matures, his relationship to his estate and trustees changes. He’s no longer bound to their instructions, but free to access his inheritance as he pleases. Similarly, Jewish laws chain the blessings of inheritance to certain badges of identity (Galatians 4:3, 8-10).

But God sent his son Jesus and placed him under the “slavery” of Jewish laws. Jesus obeyed all those laws. He is now the master of the estate and freely grants access to his inheritance by adopting anyone who trusts him into his family (Galatians 4:4-5). This means God’s people are no longer slaves to the Jewish laws, but children and heirs of a great estate (Galatians 4:6-7). It makes no sense to readopt the markers of a former trust and trustee relationship because we are now known by God as sons, daughters, and heirs (Galatians 4:8-10). No one once freed goes back to slavery.

Paul is heartbroken (Galatians 4:11, 20). He taught the Galatians freedom and he wants them to join him in that freedom (Galatians 4:12). Their first meeting was marked by their freely given generosity, care, and patience as Paul suffered through a serious illness (Galatians 4:13-15). He wondered how so much relational trust could be lost by the words of a few teachers (Galatians 4:16-17). Paul, like a mother, desperately wants his Galatian children to know the freedom they have in Jesus once again (Galatians 4:19).

Where is the Gospel?

The Galatians don’t trust that God makes slaves into his children simply by trusting Jesus. Paul says they’re like Abraham. God promised to give Abraham’s wife Sarah a child but Abraham didn’t trust God’s promise. Instead, he tried to secure a child through his slave, Hagar (Galatians 4:21-23). Likewise, the Galatians don’t trust God’s promise. They don’t trust that Jesus is the heir of God’s estate and freely promises to make those who trust him into God’s children. Instead, and like Abraham, they try to make and secure children of God by choosing slavery (Galatians 4:24-25).

Quoting from the prophet Isaiah, Paul says that becoming God’s child has always been dependent on God’s promise. He promised to open Sarah’s womb, and he has promised to make us his sons and daughters by trusting Jesus alone (Galatians 4:27; Isaiah 54:1-2). We don’t need to keep a set of laws to be included into God’s family. By faith we have become, like Abraham’s son Isaac, heirs of God’s inheritance by his promise (Galatians 4:28).

Since Abraham’s day, it’s always been the case that those who insist on the power of trusting God’s promise have been at odds with those who demand slavery to a set of rules (Galatians 4:29). But slave-makers have no place among the free people of God (Galatians 4:30). So brothers and sisters in Jesus, trust God’s promise. Jesus has made us heirs to his Kingdom. Refuse slavery and be free.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who gives us an inheritance. And may you see Jesus as the one who was enslaved under the law to free us from its power.

The disciples come to Jesus with a burning question: Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven? Jesus answers by calling over a child (Matthew 18:2). Children didn’t have a high social standing. They were of low importance. Jesus says that making less of yourself is the path to greatness in the Kingdom (Matthew 18:4). 

Not only are we to take a low position like children, but we are to care for children in a low position. This includes helping children stay away from sin and leading them to God (Matthew 18:6). We should care for children like a shepherd cares for his sheep and seeks one out if it gets lost (Matthew 18:12). 

Jesus talks about the dangers of sin. If a fellow believer falls into sin, the church should correct him and forgive him if he repents. 

Peter then asks, “How many times shall I forgive my brother?” Jesus responds with, “Seventy times seven”. This is a figure of speech as if to say,

 

“Stop counting.” 

Jesus emphasizes this point by telling a parable about a master who forgives an uncountable debt to his servant. However, this servant is unwilling to forgive a small debt owed to him (Matthew 18:28). The story highlights that God’s forgiveness propels our forgiveness. When we don’t forgive, we show that we don’t grasp how much God has forgiven us.

Where is the Gospel?

The two parables in this passage show us how we are to treat one another and children. But they also show us how Jesus has treated us as his children. 

Jesus depicts himself as a shepherd leaving his ninety-nine sheep to find one that strayed. He left heaven and the company of myriads of angels (Matthew 18:10) to come and call out these 12 disciples. Ultimately, Jesus is the good shepherd who pursues each of his sheep individually. 

He is also compared to a king forgiving his servant’s debts. Jesus is a heavenly King, and the debt we owe is not some earthly currency, but an unpayable spiritual debt of sin. Yet Jesus not only forgave that debt—he paid it in full by taking the sentence we deserved on the cross (Galatians 3:13). 

Jesus alone has power and status in the Kingdom of God. Yet he seeks after us like children, delivers us from temptation, rescues us like lost sheep, and forgives us over and over again without keeping count. 

And Jesus accomplished all this by laying down his rights. He did not use his identity as God to get out of what he swore to do for us on the cross. Instead, he humbled himself fully to save us, rescue us, and pay our debt (Philippians 2:8). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who goes after his lost children. And may you see Jesus as the one who humbly paid our debt."

Jesus has condemned and rebuked the religious leaders at the temple, culminating in his statement that the temple will soon be destroyed (Matthew 24:2). 

But the disciples thought that if the temple is ending, then the world must be ending, too. They ask Jesus when all of this will happen (Matthew 24:3). 

Jesus references several prophecies that talk about the temple’s destruction (Daniel 9:27). He knew that within a generation, the temple would be destroyed—and it was in A.D. 70.

But Jesus then addresses the disciples’ question about the end of the world . While signs and indicators predicted the end of the temple, the coming of Jesus would be different. 

Jesus instructs his disciples to keep watch because no one knows the day or time. Each day, they should act like the master will return.

Using three stories, Jesus says what his coming will be like. 

The story of the virgins and their lamps emphasizes the importance to wait and watch for Jesus’ return (Matthew 25:1). The story of the servants entrusted with gold should lead us to work today in light of his coming (Matthew 25:14). And the story of the sheep and goats should stir us to have compassion toward those in need, even as Jesus had compassion on us (Matthew 25:32). 

All three stories show the weight of consequence. For those who don’t keep watch, there is weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 25:30). But for those who wait and watch in the way of Jesus, there is a reward like an eternal banquet.

Instead of a timeline, Jesus gives his disciples a mindset. He sets their expectations for what’s coming so they can live alert and expectant. 

Where is the Gospel?

The temple stood under God’s wrath because it no longer filled its purpose. But Jesus perfectly filled the temple’s purpose on the cross (Hebrews 9:11). Every sacrifice that could ever take place in the temple was completed by him (Hebrews 10:12). 

More than this, God’s temple is no longer a building—it’s those who put their faith in Jesus and are filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 2:21). This is good news! God no longer dwells in a house that we can’t enter. Instead, God has made his house in the bodies of his people. 

Jesus uses the image of a wedding feast to portray his coming. He is the bridegroom, and the Church is his bride. His death and resurrection unites our lives to his forever (Ephesians 5:25). For those who follow Jesus, it is our joy to wait in expectation for the coming Bridegroom to claim us as his bride.

Our hope is not based in doing enough while the master is gone. Instead, our eager expectation and hope for our coming King changes our lives to become images of the one we long for.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who owns the world and judges accordingly. And may you see Jesus as the King who will return in glory."

Jesus is dead, and his body is buried. Out of fear that some of his fanatic followers would steal his body and claim his resurrection, the Roman authorities seal the grave and post guards to protect the tomb (Matthew 27:64).

Two days after they watched Jesus die, two women named Mary come to his grave: one his mother, and one a friend and supporter (Luke 8:2). 

Without warning, an earthquake strikes and an angel appears, opening the tomb (Matthew 28:2). At this, the soldiers guarding the tomb faint in fright. 

The angel tells the women that Jesus isn’t there. He has risen, just as he promised.

 

The angel invites them to see the tomb, and commands them to go and tell the disciples to meet with Jesus in Galilee (Matthew 28:7).

The women run with this message for the disciples only to encounter Jesus! They throw themselves at his feet and worship (Matthew 28:9).

The disciples head for Galilee where they find Jesus. At this reunion, Jesus gives a new mission to his followers. They will travel all over the world, telling all nations about Jesus (Matthew 28:19). 

Matthew’s Gospel ends with this final charge from Jesus, including a promise to his disciples: He will be with them forever.

Where is the Gospel?

God’s rule and authority overpowers all kingdoms of this world. Rome could not stop God’s good purposes—and neither could the grave. 

Death’s stronghold, held in place by a heavy stone, is rolled away by the power of God.

 

Jesus is Lord of all, King of Kings, and his resurrection proves that there is no authority greater than his.

The angel of the Lord and Jesus say the same thing: Do not be afraid (Matthew 28:10). Those words were never more applicable than at the empty tomb of Jesus. Through faith in Jesus, Christians do not have to live in fear anymore. Because of the resurrection, death has lost its power. The curse that came on the whole earth after Adam and Eve’s fall in the Garden of Eden has finally been conquered (Genesis 2:17). Death and decay are defeated. Jesus has won.

We can trust that because Jesus rose, someday we will rise, too (Romans 6:5). There is life beyond the grave, and Jesus is our living proof.

The resurrection stirs both doubt and worship in the disciples (Matthew 28:17). But Jesus gives even more good news when he caps off his commission to them with these words: “Surely I am with you always”.  

They weren’t just sent by Jesus; they were sent with Jesus.

 

They would leave Jerusalem filled with the same power that raised Jesus from the dead—God’s Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8). The good news is that we can live with his resurrected Spirit inside us, comforting and empowering us to carry out the work of sharing this good news and making disciples.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who raises the dead to life. And may you see Jesus as the risen King with all authority."

Jesus’ birth narrative includes tense and painful moments—a marriage falling apart, political deception, escape from danger, even infant slaughter. Yet for every difficult scene, Matthew tells us God is fulfilling Scripture. He does this to show that God will use even opposition to bring his plans to fruition.

 

First, Matthew tells us a prophecy about a virgin conceiving a child who will be called Immanuel, which means God with us (Isaiah 7:14). Mary is this pregnant virgin (Matthew 1:18). And before her fiancé Joseph can divorce her, an angel comes and tells him to name the child Jesus, which means God saves (Matthew 1:21). God would save people from their sins by being with them in Jesus. 

The next two fulfilled Scriptures connect Jesus to the story of Moses. The king over Bethlehem sought to kill Jesus by putting to death every boy two years old and under (Matthew 2:18). Warned in a vision, Jesus and his family flee to Egypt. Like Moses, Jesus escapes the infant slaughter of a murderous king (Exodus 1:22).

 

And like Moses, Jesus will rise up to redeem Israel from their slavery once and for all.

To fulfill the prophets yet again, God tells Joseph it is safe to leave Egypt and return home. Jesus comes up out of Egypt just as Israel did (Matthew 2:20). Jesus is not only the new Moses but also the new Israel, succeeding in every place the Hebrew people failed. Jesus will accomplish what Israel never could: complete obedience to the Lord.

Where is the Gospel?

Everything about Jesus’ birth would have gone wrong if not for divine intervention.

 

Mary and Joseph would have divorced, Herod would have killed Jesus, Joseph wouldn’t have fled to Egypt, and the family wouldn’t have returned to safety.

God intervened in the worst situation to fulfill the grand story of salvation he had been telling for thousands of years. 

Just as God intervened then, he intervenes now. Were it not for Jesus, we would be dead in our sins (Ephesians 2:1)

. 

But Jesus intervenes to bring the spiritually dead to life. He saves us, as his name promised. This is good news.

Just as the circumstances of Jesus’ birth fulfilled Old Testament passages, so Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection fulfilled the names he was given. Jesus is Immanuel—God with us to save us. 

See for Yourself 

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who intervenes to bring about salvation. And may you see Jesus as the one who is with us to save us from our sins."

Matthew's Gospel begins with a genealogy. This genealogy highlights two of his ancestors—Father Abraham and King David (Matthew 1:1). Through the genealogy of Jesus, Matthew is proving that Jesus is the direct recipient of all the promises and covenants made to Abraham and David.

Matthew lists four mothers in a long line of fathers and sons. They are Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba. Tamar masqueraded as a prostitute and slept with her father-in-law (Genesis 38:16). Rahab was a prostitute (Joshua 2:1). Ruth is a widow and a foreigner (Ruth 1:4). And Bathsheba was the subject of a scandal involving adultery and murder by King David himself (2 Samuel 11:2). 

But there’s more. Strictly speaking, none of these women were Jewish. Rahab, Ruth, and Tamar were Gentiles. Bathsheba married Uriah the Hittite and thus part of a Gentile household. Why does this matter? Because long ago, God made a promise.

Where is the Gospel?

God promised Abraham that his descendants would become a blessing to every nation on earth, not just the Jewish people (Genesis 12:3). And Jesus, the son of Abraham, is the one who brings this worldwide blessing.

Jesus is also the son of David. David was Israel's greatest king. God promised that one of David’s descendants would come and reign on his throne forever (2 Samuel 7:16). This promised king would bring justice and peace to the earth like never before (Isaiah 9:7). Jesus, the son of David, is the promised ruler who has come. 

The third title given to Jesus in this genealogy is the Jewish title Messiah, or Christ. The Messiah was an anointed leader who would liberate the Jews (Isaiah 61:4). But Jesus didn’t bring liberation from the Romans, as many wanted. Instead, he died on a Roman cross to pay for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2). 

Jesus, the Christ, is the anointed leader who liberates the whole world from sin. 

Combined, these three titles reveal Jesus as the anointed king who will bless all nations. What may look to us like a long list of names is one of the most significant theological statements in the Bible. For in it, we see that Jesus will complete everything God has been doing up to this point. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who keeps his promises and works through history for his purposes. And may you see Jesus as the King who sets us free."

In Matthew 3, John the Baptist boldly proclaimed Jesus is God’s anointed servant, called the Christ or Messiah. Many Jews believed the Messiah would be a military leader who would overthrow the Roman occupation and re-establish a royal throne in Jerusalem. 

Instead, Jesus is a homeless teacher. Worse still, John the Baptist finds himself imprisoned by the very powers many thought Jesus would usurp (Matthew 11:2). 

So it’s not surprising that John sends some of his followers to ask Jesus directly. Is he really God’s chosen Redeemer?

Jesus answers with a list of actions he has done. The blind see, the lame walk, lepers and cleansed, the deaf hear, and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them (Matthew 11:5).

  

This was not the politically charged answer, filled with vindication, that the people were expecting.

Jesus then rebukes several Galilean towns that witnessed his miracles with their eyes but were not willing to believe his message (Matthew 11:21). Jesus says their punishment will be worse than any judgment seen in the Old Testament (Matthew 11:22). 

They did not believe because no one can truly know who Jesus is unless he reveals himself to them (Matthew 11:27). And in a prayer, Jesus thanks God that the truth is hidden from the wise and revealed to “little children” (Matthew 11:25).

Where is the Gospel?

John’s disciples ask a question we all ask today, “Is Jesus the Savior we need?”

Jesus answers from an Old Testament passage from the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah wrote that God would restore Israel’s glory and bring vengeance and judgment (Isaiah 35:4). That was the salvation people wanted. 

But Jesus would not bring salvation through violence. In the very next verse, Isaiah says salvation will be far more like healing the sick than conquering the powerful (Isaiah 35:5).

We have sickness, disease, impurity, deafness, blindness, and poverty both physically and spiritually. Our physical death and diseases resulted from a spiritual rebellion (Genesis 2:17). 

So Jesus comes and saves us from our worst enemy—sin and the consequence of death. 

But what are we to make of Jesus thanking God for hiding his identity from the towns who will be destroyed? 

Jesus tells us who his identity is hidden from—the wise and understanding. He did not come to save those who think they are secure, but those who know they are not.

 

That is why he could say to those who believed in him, “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who reveals his Son to those who need him most. And may you see Jesus as God’s chosen servant who offers us merciful rest."

Like Moses stood on Mt. Sinai to give the first law in Exodus, Jesus now stands on a mountain to talk about how we fulfill the law in Matthew. 

He begins his sermon on the mount with a list of blessings to the poor in spirit, the mourning, the persecuted. Jesus is telling the Israelites in exile that though they are impoverished, mournful, and persecuted, they are now blessed because Jesus is there to bring them out of exile and wilderness and into his Kingdom. 

Jesus continues by explaining that citizens of the Kingdom live by God’s Law. As they do this, others notice and glorify God, the way a light shines from a lampstand (Matthew 5:16). This was the point of the original Law given through Moses in Exodus—that Israel would be a light to the nations (Isaiah 42:6). 

But many obey the Law for their own glory. They pray, fast, and give in order to be seen by people, rather than loving from a sincere heart (Matthew 6:2). Instead of seeking human approval, Jesus encourages his listeners to trust that there is a reward in heaven stored up for them (Matthew 6:20).

In his sermon on the mount, Jesus shows us that God is after our hearts, not just our actions. He says that anger is like murder and lust like adultery (Matthew 5:28). Jesus aims at our hearts, a place within us that the Law, by itself, could not reach (Romans 8:3). 

Nevertheless, these laws are meant to be lived, not just heard. To hear and do nothing is to build upon sand. To hear the Teacher, trust, and obey is to find a sure foundation (Matthew 7:24).

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus said he came to fulfill the Law. This is good news because no one had yet taught, understood, or obeyed it perfectly.

 

Jesus didn’t just give us right teaching. He lived it out on our behalf. He loved his enemies by dying for them (Romans 5:8). He prayed, “Father, forgive them,” when persecuted on the cross. He turned his cheek when struck by Roman guards (Matthew 27:30). Through Jesus, we are lead into this new Kingdom life.

Jesus points out two paths—the broad way and the narrow way (Matthew 7:13). There are many ways to destroy our lives, but only one way to restore them. And the good news is that through Jesus, we can be saved.

 

Jesus is our narrow way.

 

Jesus is also our solid rock. To put faith in Jesus is to find the surest footing for today and for eternity—he is true wisdom and obedience. 

Jesus’ sermon on the mount ends with many being denied access to his presence on account of their works alone (Matthew 7:23). It is those whom he truly knows who he welcomes in. Knowing Jesus is our firm foundation.

If Jesus is the Messiah, why can’t everyone see it? This is the question Matthew wants us to ponder as we read Matthew 13. Up to this point, people have doubted who Jesus is. John the Baptist and his messengers doubted he was the Messiah (Matthew 11:3). The Pharisees hurled all kinds of doubtful accusations at him (Matthew 12:2). 

But Jesus answers this question with several parables. Each has a unique contribution to Jesus’ teaching on the Kingdom of God, but in Matthew 13 they all share one message: The Kingdom of God is hidden. 

Through parables about seeds, wheat, treasure, and fish, Jesus says that the Kingdom of God is like a secret (Matthew 13:44). But this secret isn’t revealed to everyone. Like the parables about the sower, wheat, and fish, some get it and others don’t (Matthew 13:48). 

Why is this? Jesus quotes a prophecy from Isaiah, “You will indeed hear but never understand, you will indeed see but never perceive” (Matthew 13:14). 

You see, humanity’s heart had become hard. Their ears had grown dull. Their eyes had closed shut (Matthew 13:15). So they could not believe, hear, or see the truth of what Jesus was doing. 

So how did anyone, like the disciples, come to believe? Jesus says it is because the ability to know the secrets of the Kingdom of heaven had been given to them, but to others, it had not been given (Matthew 13:11). 

The difference between those who hear and those who don’t is a free gift. 

Where is the Gospel?

The point of this passage is that the Kingdom of God is like a secret, hidden from the world. Because of our hard hearts and dull ears, all humanity would have rejected it and received a punishment Jesus refers to as “weeping and gnashing of teeth” (Matthew 13:42). 

But the good news is that God has revealed his Kingdom to us in the person of Jesus (Matthew 11:27). In fact, the hidden secret is fully revealed in him. 

After all, who thinks dying on a cross is the right way to build a kingdom? But the seemingly insignificant life and death of Jesus would grow like a mustard seed into the Kingdom of God. 

Jesus has revealed these secrets and offered to save us from the weeping and gnashing of teeth we deserve. Those who understand the gift of Jesus are like a man who comes across a pearl of great price and sells everything he has to buy it (Matthew 13:46).

The point is not how much you are willing to pay to buy it. We’ve already seen that the Kingdom is a free gift. The point is, do you see Jesus as worth everything?

 

If you do, Jesus says to you today what he said to his disciples then, “Blessed are your eyes, for they see” (Matthew 13:16). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has had a hidden plan from the beginning of time. And may you see Jesus as the only one who perfectly completes that plan. "

Matthew tells us the prophet Isaiah predicted a voice that would announce the coming of Israel’s Lord (Isaiah 40:3). Matthew tells us that John the Baptist is the voice and Jesus is the Lord.

Crowds come to John to be baptized. John explains that his baptism is temporary and preparatory. It proclaims the coming of the kingdom (Matthew 3:2) but will be eclipsed when the king comes. The king will baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire (Matthew 3:11). 

Jesus arrives at the water and asks John to baptize him (Matthew 3:13). When he comes up from the water, Matthew gives us a portrait of the Trinity: God the Son in the flesh, God the Spirit as a dove, and God the Father as a voice saying, “This is my beloved Son” (Matthew 3:17). This unique display of God’s presence is meant to ratify Jesus as the one Israel has waited for.

 

Where is the Gospel?

John’s promise that Jesus will baptize with the Holy Spirit foreshadows the day of Pentecost in Acts 2. On that day, people who put their faith in Jesus were immersed in the waters of baptism but also immersed in the Holy Spirit. 

Jesus identified with us and our sin when he participated in a symbolic act of confession and repentance in baptism. But the baptism of Jesus identifies us with him, his holiness, and his power when we are covered with his Spirit.

Jesus also mentioned a baptism of fire. John elaborates that this fire is one of judgment (Matthew 3:12). Those who do not repent from their sins and put their trust in the coming Lord would face unquenchable fire. 

This is the baffling beauty of the Gospel. The one who has every right to judge the world for their sin instead takes on their sin (Romans 3:26). And we will also be raised to resurrected life, pictured through our rising from the waters of baptism (Romans 6:5). When we are, we will hear a similar proclamation made over us—that we too are called sons and daughters of God. 

We are adopted into God’s family through Jesus (Romans 8:16). Through the gift and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, we are brought into relational intimacy with the everlasting trinity. That is good news! 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who prepares his people for their Savior. And may you see Jesus as the sinless one who takes the place of sinners."

Matthew records many stories of Jesus healing the sick in these chapters. In these stories, we see that Jesus has no limit to the number of people, kind of people, or manner of sickness that he is willing and able to heal.

Amid these healings, Matthew tells a story about Jesus calming a storm. The disciples are amazed and wonder who Jesus is, that even the wind and the sea obeys him (Matthew 8:27). Jesus rebukes diseases and demons, even the weather. He is the one with all authority (Matthew 9:8). 

Jesus preaches and heals with a heart of compassion. When he looks at the crowds, he sees sheep without a shepherd. The Old Testament often describes Israel in this way (Numbers 27:17; 1 Kings 22:17; Isaiah 53:6; Zechariah 10:2; 2 Chronicles 18:16).

 

Jesus uses this imagery to show that he is the shepherd God’s people had long-awaited (Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 34:16; Micah 2:12). 

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus has all authority to heal diseases, drive out demons, and calm storms. 

But authority is only good news if it’s also accompanied by compassion. A leper healed by Jesus understands this when he says, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean” (Matthew 8:2). And the good news is that Jesus is both able and willing to heal. He has both authority and compassion.

 

Through all of this healing and authority, Matthew is helping us to see a deeper point Jesus is trying to make. 

While eating with some less-reputable people, the religious leaders rebuke Jesus for his choice of company. Jesus tells them that healthy people don’t need a doctor, but sick people do (Matthew 9:12). Jesus has healed many people up to this point, but in this moment Jesus diagnoses sickness as only a symptom. The real disease is sin. 

Everyone is sick from the corruption that entered the world through sin, and Jesus is the only one who can heal it. His authority demonstrates that he has power to deliver us from the underlying sickness and storms in our lives—sin and death.

Matthew tells us that Jesus’ healing ministry fulfills Isaiah 53. In this Messianic prophecy, Isaiah describes a suffering servant who would heal his people by taking on their diseases and sin (Isaiah 53:5). This is just what Jesus did on the cross for us. He provided ultimate healing for our bodies and souls by putting an end to the sin that brings destruction into our lives. He died in our sickness so we could live in his healing. “He took our illnesses and bore our diseases” (Isaiah 53:4). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has authority over all creation. And may you see Jesus who became flesh to take and heal our diseases and sin."

The religious leaders accuse Jesus’ followers of being ritually unclean because they don’t wash their hands according to the “tradition of the elders” (Matthew 15:2). This isn’t a command from the Bible but from another large body of Jewish teaching.

But Jesus says the real problem isn’t unclean hands but impure hearts. Dirt and grime can be swallowed and still leave the body, but sin grows up from a defiled heart (Matthew 15:11). 

Jesus then travels far north into Gentile territory where he meets a Canaanite woman (Matthew 15:21). The Canaanites were Israel’s constant enemy throughout the Old Testament. 

The traditions of the Jewish people would have kept Jesus from interacting with this woman. But her courageous faith moves Jesus, and he heals her demon-oppressed daughter (Matthew 15:28). 

Jesus then repeats what he did in the wilderness among the Jews, but this time among the Gentiles. He heals the sick, and they worship the God of Israel (Matthew 15:31). Jesus miraculously feeds 4,000 men, as he did before for the 5,000. 

But the Jewish religious leaders don’t understand what Jesus is doing, and they demand a sign (Matthew 16:1). Jesus tells his disciples to beware of their “leaven” (Matthew 16:6). He was warning them to not let the unbelief of the Pharisees and Sadducees spread to them, as leaven spreads through dough.

 

Jesus reminds them that they picked up 12 baskets in the wilderness among the Jews, and seven among the Gentiles (Matthew 16:9). 

The 12 baskets would have reminded the Jews of the 12 tribes, which was a sign that Jesus was bringing salvation to all of Israel. Likewise, the seven baskets represented a sign of heavenly favor (Matthew 15:37). Jesus was not just saving the Jews with their laws and tradition.

 

He was saving the entire world, even those who did not know the law of the traditions of the elders. 

Where is the Gospel?

No matter where you come from, Jesus can provide healing and provision for you.

 

He does not perform his miracles or bring his Kingdom to a select kind of person, but to all nations and all people. 

This includes those who are unclean. Whether you have broken the religious traditions you grew up around or the very commands of God found in the Bible, Jesus shows us here that there is forgiveness for anyone who comes to him in faith (Romans 10:13). 

Traditions and rule-following cannot save you. To think otherwise is to have the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees within you. Only Jesus can save you. And when he does, he will give you a clean heart that will bring about clean actions that heal the world around you (Hebrews 8:10). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who saves unclean people from every nation and that you would see Jesus as the one who took our uncleanness so he could provide the bread of his body to anyone who would come to him in faith."

In Matthew 10, Jesus gives his closest followers a special mission and a special authority. 

He tells them to preach what he has preached and do what he has done (Matthew 10:7). They are to announce the arrival of God’s Kingdom and heal the sick. 

But along with this new mission comes a list of warnings. People will ignore or reject their message, and they will attack and persecute them as messengers (Matthew 10:17). This mission will cost these disciples more than they can imagine. 

But three different times, Jesus tells them not to be afraid.

First, Jesus tells them not to be afraid because everything hidden will be made known (Matthew 10:26). He links their persecution to his (Matthew 10:25). Jesus will be arrested in secret and killed under the cloak of false accusations. But his identity and victory over the grave would not be hidden when he rose from the dead. In the same way, Jesus promises he will reveal final victory out of their most hidden moments of persecution.

 

Second, Jesus reminds the disciples that they will face some who can kill their bodies but not their souls (Matthew 10:28). Their persecutors can only do so much. Jesus promises that those who lose their life for his sake will find it (Matthew 10:39). They don’t have to be afraid because Jesus can bring life out of death. 

Last, Jesus compares God’s care for birds to his attentive care for the disciples. They should not fear because God will care for them far more than he provides for birds (Matthew 10:31). 

Where is the Gospel?

This mission is a living picture of salvation and judgment through Jesus. Those who receive the disciples’ message have “peace” come upon them (Matthew 10:13). 

But the disciples shook the dust off their feet from houses and towns that rejected the gospel (Matthew 10:14). This was a symbol of the uncleanliness that remained there—a promise that judgment would come (Matthew 10:15). 

The same offer remains for us today. If we believe the message of the gospel, we have peace between ourselves and God through Christ (Romans 5:1). If we do not believe, we stand unclean and condemned (John 3:36). 

Jesus makes an incredible promise to do what only he can: to vouch for anyone who has faith in him before his Father (Matthew 10:32). This is good news because we cannot justify ourselves before God. But through faith in Jesus, we have a Savior who will proclaim us righteous before God. 

Now Jesus has called we who believe this gospel to go out as disciples (Matthew 28:19). We are to share the good news and do the works Jesus did. 

We need not fear rejection because God has accepted us in Jesus. We need not fear persecution because even in death, we will find life. And we need not fear scarcity or deprivation because God has provided us with all we need in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who sends us good news of salvation. And may you see Jesus as the Savior who acknowledges his followers before the Father."

The religious leaders test Jesus by asking his interpretation on marriage and divorce. Jesus passes their test, but not in the way they expect. 

Instead of getting lost in a debate, Jesus points to the deeper meaning of issues related to divorce (Matthew 19:8). He highlights God’s original intent for marriage, the hardness of the human heart, and the unique call to celibacy.

 

After this, a wealthy young man approaches and asks Jesus, “What good deed must I do to have eternal life?”. After the man claims that he has kept God’s commandments, Jesus asks the man to give up what matters most to him—his great wealth. 

This man wanted to earn eternal life, so Jesus asks for something he knows the man won’t give up, in order to show him that eternal life is something he can never earn. To further illustrate this, Jesus tells a parable about a master who hires workers for his vineyard. The workers aren’t paid on merit, but on the promised wage of a generous master (Matthew 20:15). 

When the mother of two disciples asks Jesus to grant her sons a position of honor in his Kingdom, Jesus again emphasizes the importance of humility (Matthew 20:21). Those who wish to be great must serve. After all, Jesus came to be the servant of all by giving up his life to save others (Matthew 20:28). 

Twice, Jesus demonstrates his servant heart in this passage. First, he welcomes the children that others dismissed. Second, he heals blind men that others ignored.

Where is the Gospel? 

Just as Jesus pointed to the deeper meaning under the laws about marriage and divorce, we also must see the bigger picture marriage shows us. The marriage between a man and a woman is a symbol of Jesus’ marriage to his Church (Ephesians 5:25). 

God does not want man and woman to divorce because his marriage to us never ends. He desires our earthly marriages to reflect the eternal, unbreakable bond Jesus makes with his people, the Church. 

When the young rich man asks Jesus what he can do to earn eternal life, Jesus responds that only one is good (Matthew 19:17). Or Jesus could have said, “Only I am good.” Only Jesus could do every good thing required to earn salvation. Human effort cannot accomplish it. As Jesus said, “With man, this is impossible.” The good news is that Jesus adds, “But with God, all things are possible.” 

Salvation is possible because Jesus humbled himself on the cross. He said he would give his life as a ransom for many (Matthew 20:28). A ransom is the price of freedom for an enslaved individual. By giving his one life on the cross, Jesus has won freedom for the many.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who does not give us the wages we deserve, and Jesus as the one who earns for us the grace we don’t."

In Matthew 12, Matthew shows us the tension between the local religious leaders and Jesus. 

The religious leaders accuse Jesus of violating the Sabbath, which commanded rest (Matthew 12:2). Jesus points out that priests in the temple work on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:5). And something greater than the Sabbath and the temple is now here. 

To emphasize this, Jesus goes to Sabbath services at a synagogue and heals a man’s withered hand, which was considered an act of work (Matthew 12:10). 

The Pharisees claim that Jesus’ power to heal comes from demons (Matthew 12:24). But Jesus isn’t using Satan’s power; he’s working by the Spirit of God. 

Proof of the Holy Spirit’s work was obvious in the result of his actions—healing and casting out demons. Good fruit points to a good tree (Matthew 12:33). Jesus says he is the good tree. The fruit of God’s Spirit proves that Jesus is God in the flesh. But the Pharisees were bad trees, unable to produce or see good fruit (Matthew 12:34). 

The religious leaders demand that Jesus prove he is the Messiah (Matthew 12:38), but Jesus promises only “the sign of Jonah” (Matthew 12:39). Jesus predicts his resurrection by referencing the prophet Jonah’s three days in the belly of a fish. The resurrection will be the final proof of Jesus’ identity.

But they do not believe. They believe themselves to be wise like King Solomon, but Jesus tells them that something greater than Solomon is now here (Matthew 12:42)

. 

Where is the Gospel? 

The accusation of the Pharisees was not true of Jesus, but it is true of us. All sinners are under the power of Satan (Ephesians 2:2).

 

But when we put our faith in Jesus, the Holy Spirit makes us good trees, able to produce the good fruit of faith (1 Corinthians 12:3). 

The Law of Moses could never turn a bad tree into a good tree (Romans 12:3). The command to rest on the Sabbath could not create rest in our restless hearts. 

We needed something greater than the Law. Jesus claims to be what we truly need (Matthew 12:41). He is greater than the Sabbath because his rest is perpetual  earned for us, and free to receive. He is greater than the Temple because he is God present, not in a building, but a body. 

Jesus is greater than Jonah because he did not come from the belly of a fish to be God’s messenger to one city. He is God himself, who came from the belly of the grave to reach all the nations. 

And Jesus is greater than the wise King Solomon, who built the temple.

 

Jesus is the King of kings and the wisdom of God, embodying God in the flesh. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who revealed himself through the Law, the temple, and people like Jonah. And may you see Jesus as the one who is greater than them all because he is God’s final and perfect revelation."

Who is Jesus? This is a question Jesus poses to his disciples in Matthew 16. According to the disciples, most people think of Jesus as a prophet. But Jesus wants to know what the disciples think (Matthew 16:15). Peter declares that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah and the Son of God (Matthew 16:16).

Immediately after affirming Peter’s confession, Jesus tells them that he must die and rise again. Not only will he go to the cross, but he announces that all who follow him must die to themselves as well (Matthew 16:24). 

After this, Jesus leads his three closest followers up a mountain, and there he transfigures before them, becoming as blinding as the sun (Matthew 17:2). The figures of Moses and Elijah also appear, representing all the Law and the Prophets (Matthew 17:3). Peter suggests that they build tents for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah (Matthew 17:4). 

Peter realizes this is a Mt. Sinai moment all over again

 

(Exodus 19:16). And just as God’s glory moved into the tabernacle at Sinai, perhaps three small tents would be a fitting residence to these men as well. But God’s voice interrupts, calls Jesus his “beloved Son,” and tells the disciples to “listen to him” (Matthew 17:5). 

These words on the mountain echo the same words Moses spoke to Israel when he said, “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me… it is to him you shall listen” (Deuteronomy 18:15)

When the disciples look up, Moses and Elijah have disappeared, and only Jesus is left. Everything that Moses and Elijah represented in the Old Testament, called the Law and the Prophets, has now culminated in Jesus.

 

Unlike Sinai, God no longer needs a tent to hold his presence and glory. Instead, the fullness of his presence is found in the person of Jesus.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus affirmed Peter’s declaration that he was the Messiah. But Jesus knew that being the Messiah meant dying. And the good news is that Jesus willingly took up his cross to bring God’s Kingdom into our world. 

Now, he calls us to carry our own cross as citizens in that Kingdom. This is not a punishment but a blessing.

 

Jesus says taking up our cross and following him is the only way to salvation (Matthew 16:25). 

In this context, taking up our cross means being willing to die as Jesus will die. It is a wholehearted belief in and devotion to the fact that even in death, God wins. This is not faith in our own sacrifice, but Jesus’. For in his death, there is life. In his cross, God wins.

 

Finally, we see the beauty of Jesus’ transfiguration. In this story, we get a glimpse of the true glory of Jesus’ deity. He is God himself (Colossians 1:15). And this glorious God declares to us before and after this story that he is going to die (Matthew 17:22). 

The immeasurable grace and mercy of God is displayed not only as Jesus becomes a living tabernacle as a human, but as he also becomes the ultimate sacrifice offered in that tabernacle. The Son of God, in the flesh, died for us to fulfill all of God’s plans. That is amazing grace. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who wins, even in death. And may you see Jesus as the one who bore his cross so we might have life when all we deserve is death."

The Jewish leaders have condemned Jesus, but only the Roman authorities had the power to kill. So Jesus stands before Pilate, the Roman governor, awaiting his sentence. 

But there’s a problem. Pilate can’t find any reason to condemn him. Jesus is innocent (Matthew 27:23). 

Instead, Pilate lets the crowd choose one prisoner to release: Jesus or a violent revolutionary named Barabbas (Matthew 27:21). They choose to release the criminal over the innocent man. 

Roman soldiers then flog Jesus and mockingly hail him as King of the Jews, not knowing that they are actually standing before the King of Kings (Matthew 27:29). 

When they arrive at Golgotha, outside the city gates of Jerusalem, the Roman soldiers crucify Jesus. 

After hours on the cross, Jesus cries out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Then, Jesus dies. 

Several things happen at the moment of his death: the veil of the temple is torn, an earthquake strikes so forcefully that tombs break open, and out of those tombs come the resurrected bodies of “holy people” (Matthew 27:51-52). 

In response to this, the guards assigned to Jesus are both afraid and in awe. They declare that Jesus must have really been the Son of God.

Where is the Gospel?

The story of Jesus’ death is heart-wrenching to read. And it should be. Yet in this painful story, we see so much good news. 

The criminal Barabbas was released instead of Jesus, showing us a picture of the undeserved freedom we experience because of Jesus’ death. The innocent man is condemned to die, while the criminal is set free. 

From the cross, Jesus cries out, asking why God has forsaken him. These words come from Psalm 22, which describes circumstances eerily similar to Jesus’ trial and crucifixion: mocking from all sides, pierced hands, and feet, casting lots for clothing (Psalm 22:16). 

Jesus showed that the events of his death have been set on a course from the beginning. The cross was Jesus’ long-standing plan to be forsaken, so we might be accepted. 

We also see good news in the three immediate effects of Jesus’ death. 

First, the temple curtain was torn to show that God’s people are no longer separated from God’s presence (Hebrews 10:19). Instead, God’s Spirit would soon come and live in them as his new temples. 

Second, the dead rise. This is a foretaste of what Jesus himself will do and a sign that because of Jesus’ saving work, death no longer has the final word over God’s people (1 Corinthians 15:23). Those who put their faith in Jesus will be raised because of his death and resurrection.

 

Third, Gentile soldiers are convinced Jesus is God’s Son. This foreshadows the spreading of the good news to all nations, so that every tribe and tongue may hear and declare that Jesus Christ is Lord (Revelation 7:9).

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who loves us enough to die for us. And may you see Jesus as the innocent one who died in our place."

These chapters highlight the problem of corruptible religion and the necessity of trusting that Jesus has come as the Son of God to set it right.

The section opens as Jesus enters Jerusalem, riding a young donkey and receiving a king’s welcome. The crowd cheers for him, and for a moment it seems like people recognize Jesus as the Messiah (Matthew 21:9). 

In a symbolic act of cleansing, Jesus enters the temple and drives out the merchants inside. The temple had become corrupted, and Jesus passed his judgment on it. 

In the same way, Jesus curses a fruitless fig tree (Matthew 21:19). This is a living picture of what happened at the temple. Like the fig tree, the temple had stopped being productive. So Jesus curses it.

 

Jesus then tells three parables, painting the religious leaders as disobedient children, murderous tenants, and dismissive invitees to a wedding banquet.

Different religious groups take turns trying to trick Jesus into saying something incriminating by asking him loaded theological questions. But Jesus constantly outwits their schemes with God’s truth. 

Finally, Jesus responds with his own question from the psalms about the Christ (Matthew 22:42). The religious leaders cannot give an answer and are silenced.

Jesus issues seven woes directly to the Pharisees and scribes. They preach a version of the truth, but they do not live it. 

Jesus laments that Jerusalem, the city of God’s people, has refused to come to him (Matthew 23:37). Like the withered fig tree and the coming destruction of the temple, Jesus says that they, too, are desolate (Matthew 23:38). 

Where is the Gospel?

At least two prophecies were fulfilled when Jesus entered Jerusalem on a donkey. One spoke of Israel’s long-awaited King, coming to her on a donkey (Zechariah 9:9). The other was fulfilled as people chanted, “Hosanna,” meaning “save us,” from Psalm 118:25. 

Jesus would answer this cry for salvation by doing what the temple had failed to do. By clearing it of its merchants, Jesus halted the operation of the sacrificial system as a prophetic demonstration of how his sacrificial death would end the need for the temple system once and for all. 

You might ask yourself, “How can I avoid being like the Pharisees that Jesus rebukes?” There’s much we can learn from Jesus’ stern words—including “practice what you preach”—but one lesson stands above the rest:

 

Do not reject Jesus.

The Pharisees are like a son who says he will obey his father, but their rejection of Jesus shows they will not. They are like tenants of a vineyard who foolishly plan to kill their master’s son (Matthew 21:38). And they are like ignorant guests, refusing an invitation to a great wedding feast (Matthew 22:5). 

How can we not be like the Pharisees? Accept Jesus! 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who answers our prayer for rescue. And may you see Jesus as the Savior who accomplishes this rescue by replacing the temple with his own flesh and blood."

After passing through the waters in his baptism, Jesus is led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil (Matthew 4:1). Jesus fasts for forty days and forty nights, which connects this story with another familiar story in the Old Testament.

Israel also passed through the waters when God parted the Red Sea. From there, God led Moses and the people into the wilderness (Exodus 15:22). They were on their way to the land of Canaan, the Promised Land, where God would establish his Kingdom. And like Jesus, Moses also fasted for forty days and forty nights in the wilderness while on Mt. Sinai (Exodus 34:28). 

But in the wilderness, Israel fell into temptation and sin, and they failed to set up the forever-Kingdom of God (Exodus 32:1). 

But Jesus succeeds where Israel failed. He resists temptation in the wilderness. Israel failed to banish their enemies in Cannan, but Jesus drives out the real enemy with only a word (Matthew 4:10). God called Israel to possess a promised piece of land, but Jesus shows his authority over all creation (Revelation 21:5).

 

Jesus is the new and better Moses and Israel, who brings God’s rule and reign to the world.

It’s no wonder, then, that Jesus’ first message is about God’s Kingdom coming near (Matthew 4:17). He calls the first four citizens into that Kingdom and says they will fish for men (Matthew 4:19). God promised in Jeremiah 16:16 that fishermen and hunters would come who would bring people from all nations into his Kingdom. And in Jesus, this promise becomes reality. 

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus was tempted like us in every way, yet he did not sin (Hebrews 4:15). Israel had failed to overcome sin and the devil by their own power, but Jesus declares that he has overcome the world (John 16:33).

 

Jesus overcame the devil in the wilderness and ultimately at the cross.

Satan literally means “accuser.” His greatest weapon is accusations against us. These accusations about our sins and shortcomings leave us condemned.

 

But when Jesus took our condemnation on the cross, he left Satan with nothing but lies and empty threats.

 

Now there is no condemnation for those in Jesus (Romans 8:1). That is how he puts the powers of Satan to open shame (Colossians 2:15). 

We can resist sin because the same Spirit in us is the same Spirit that led and empowered Jesus to resist by the Word of God (Romans 8:11). Jesus has freed us from the power of sin, death, and the devil, and has declared us citizens in the Kingdom like his first followers. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who refuses to leave us in our sin and condemnation. May you see Jesus as the one who succeeded where we failed so he might give us victory where we only deserved defeat."

After God declares Jesus his Son at the transfiguration, Jesus has two other “son” related encounters. 

The first is a father asking for Jesus to heal his epileptic son (Matthew 17:15). Jesus laments when he finds out his own disciples could not heal the boy (Matthew 17:17). After Jesus casts out the demon that caused these epileptic fits, he explains to the disciples that their failure was due to a lack of faith (Matthew 17:20). With just a small seed of faith in him, Jesus said, nothing would be impossible.

 

They could command an immovable mountain to move, and it would.

Immediately after this, Jesus predicts his death again. This speaks directly to the issue of faith in the last story. The disciples do not believe that Jesus must die and rise again (Matthew 16:22). So Jesus directs them to the object of their faith—namely, his upcoming death and resurrection. 

In the second son-related story, Jesus and Peter talk about the temple tax. Men, ages 20-50, had to pay this tax, which helped pay for the upkeep of the Jewish temple. Jesus asks if kings tax their own kids. The assumed answer is, “Of course they don’t.” 

Jesus is saying that the tax is for the temple, which is God’s house. Since he is the King’s Son, he is exempt from the tax. Still, Jesus sends Peter to catch a fish and promises that inside the fish he’ll find the money to pay the tax for them both (Matthew 17:27). So Jesus avoids offense and displays his unique power as God’s Son.

Where is the Gospel? 

There is one mountain no one in the world could move—the inescapable climb toward death. But as in the story with the epileptic son, just a little faith in Jesus gives us victory over sickness and Satan, both of which lead to death. 

When we trust that Jesus went to the cross to bear our illnesses, sins, and condemnation, we get to do the impossible (Isaiah 53:4).

 

We get to escape our diseases, the devil’s oppression, and the grave. Some of that will happen now, as God’s Kingdom comes. But all of it will happen soon, in our resurrection (Revelation 21:4). 

When speaking with Peter about taxes, Jesus says that “the sons are free”. The miracle that follows doesn’t just pay for Jesus; it pays for Peter, too. Later, Jesus’ resurrection won’t just mean new life for Jesus. It will mean new life for all of his followers, too.

 

Because of Jesus’ saving work, anyone with faith in Jesus has been adopted into God’s family (Ephesians 1:5).

 

1 John 3:1 says, “See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are.” Anyone with faith in Jesus is now a son or daughter of the King. They are free, too. Free from sin. Free from the law. Free from death. As Jesus said, “the sons are free.” 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who loves us like his own children. And may you see Jesus as the one who makes us sons and daughters of God."

John the Baptist is dead. But Herod, Rome’s political liaison over Galilee, saw the miracles Jesus performed and thought he might be John raised from the dead (Matthew 14:2). 

But what Jesus does next shows that he is greater than John. 

When Jesus hears news of John’s death, Jesus gets in a boat and crosses the water to spend time in solitude in the wilderness (Matthew 14:13). But people meet him there like they met John in the wilderness earlier. So we wonder as Herod wondered: Is Jesus a new John the Baptist? Or is he something far more? 

There in the wilderness, Jesus heals the sick and multiplies five loaves of bread and two fish until they feed 5,000 men, plus women and children (Matthew 14:20). This ministry in the wilderness reminds us of John, but it should also remind us of Moses.

Just like Jesus, Israel made a journey through the waters and into the wilderness. There, God provided bread and meat miraculously for the people (Exodus 16:4). But instead of this bread coming from heaven, it comes from Jesus himself. Jesus is greater than John. He’s greater than Moses. He is God.

After this miracle, a bad storm carries the boat out with the disciples in it. Jesus walks on the stormy waters to reach them. He even calls Peter out on the water, making him able to stand on the sea as long as his faith in Jesus remained firm (Matthew 14:25). 

After seeing this display of power, the disciples worship Jesus and say, “Truly you are the Son of God” (Matthew 14:33). 

Moses took people through water. John immersed people in water. But Jesus walks on top of the water. 

Jesus is more than John the Baptist. He is more than Moses. He is the Son of God. 

Where is the Gospel? 

None of God’s famous messengers were able to bring final healing and deliverance. Despite all of Moses’ miracles, he did not enter the promised land of God’s Kingdom. Despite John’s dynamic public ministry, he died before seeing God’s promises fulfilled. 

But Matthew 14 shows us that Jesus is not just a miracle worker or a great teacher. He is God himself, who will once and for all bring the deliverance Moses saw and usher in the Kingdom John pronounced. 

And all we need to do is put our faith in him, as Peter did when he walked on the water (Matthew 14:31). He will heal all our diseases. He will provide us with the bread of life. He will conquer the storms. Because he is the Son of God. 

See for Yourself

Matthew shows us two meals that anticipate Jesus’ sacrifice.

In the first meal, an unnamed woman brings expensive perfume and pours it on Jesus to prepare him for burial (Matthew 26:7). Bodies were not prepared until after death, but Jesus explains that this anointing has prepared him ahead of his sacrifice.

The second meal is Passover, which was first instituted on the eve of Israel escaping from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 12:3). During this traditional meal, Jesus calls the bread his body and the wine his blood (Matthew 26:26).

 

Jesus uses the Exodus story of deliverance to point to a new deliverance that will happen through his sacrifice.

Jesus then leaves the meal with his twelve disciples and goes to a garden to pray.

Judas, the chief priests, and a crowd of armed men arrive in the garden to arrest Jesus (Matthew 26:47). One disciple tries to fight, but Jesus rebukes him. Jesus says he can call on thousands of angels in a moment’s notice, but he won’t. Why? Because the Scriptures must be fulfilled.

Jesus is taken before the high priest where the chief priests bring false testimonies against Jesus (Matthew 26:59). He doesn’t say a word until the high priest commands him to say whether he is the Messiah, the Son of God. Jesus acknowledges what they’ve said, and in their rage the religious leaders call for the death penalty (Matthew 26:64). 

Where is the Gospel?

At the first Passover, God instructed his people to kill a lamb. With the lamb’s blood, the Israelites covered their door frames to ensure protection from God’s judgment (Exodus 12:12). They ate the lamb with unleavened bread as a sign of how quickly they must flee from Egypt. Jesus is our Passover lamb, whose blood has brought forgiveness of sins and whose body is our flight from slavery. 

But why did he have to die? Jesus himself prays, “Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.” In the Old Testament, drinking a cup was a common metaphor for the judgment and wrath of God (Isaiah 51:17). 

Jesus willingly drank the cup of God’s wrath on our behalf. He experienced indescribable agony so that in him we could know unspeakable joy (Romans 3:25). 

Jesus could have stopped the angry mob. But he didn’t. Jesus knew his mission, he knew the cost, and he knew the reward.

This is Jesus, our determined, sovereign Savior who knew he would die on a cross before it happened, yet willfully went through with it. 

What a beautiful picture then, to see Jesus prepared for burial by a woman anointing him with perfume.

 

She was willing to accept Jesus’ future death, just as he was. We have a similar opportunity. We can look back to Jesus’ death, and with the eyes of faith we can accept what he did on our behalf and anoint him with our praise. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who frees us through the sacrifice of his Son. And may you see Jesus as the Passover lamb by whose blood we are forgiven."

Peter is wrapping up his second letter and wants his people to remember that Jesus is coming soon, and encourages them to live godly lives (2 Peter 3:1-2). But this reminder is unpopular among a group of false teachers. They’re skeptical that Jesus will come again and are unconvinced there’s any need to curb their desires (2 Peter 3:3).

The false teachers have two arguments. First, since the creation of the world God has failed to intervene in human history and judge evil (2 Peter 3:4). That prophesied day of judgment for our moral evil has never come, and so how we behave must not matter to God. But Peter says they're ignoring the facts.

God has intervened in human history. God pulled the land up out of the primordial waters with a simple word (2 Peter 3:5). And with another word he sank the land under a flood in response to humanity’s corruption (2 Peter 3:6). These false teachers don’t know Scripture very well, a point he’ll bring up again later (2 Peter 3:16). God has always been intimately involved in human history and his word still waits to judge the earth (2 Peter 3:7).

The false teachers’ second argument is that God is late. Jesus said he would come soon, but he hasn’t. Peter points out that an immortal God does not operate on our time scale. “Soon” to him can be very different from what it means for us (2 Peter 3:8). And besides, God is not late, he is patient (2 Peter 3:9). God doesn’t want anyone to die or experience his judgment. God’s long delay isn’t proof he doesn’t care about us, but proof that he's merciful towards people who take a long time to repent. God’s lateness is actually his patience. And for those who doubt God’s timing, God’s patience is our only hope of salvation (2 Peter 3:15).

Where is the Gospel?

We know Jesus is coming soon. On that day evil and sin will melt and dissolve (2 Peter 3:10). Soon all that will be left is what’s good and just. We should live like eternal goodness is coming soon. We should live lives that are marked by the justice and moral virtue that will endure forever (2 Peter 3:11-12). We should be careful of teachers who make us doubt Jesus’ coming judgment or the clarity of his moral commands (2 Peter 3:17). God cares how we live. And for those who know Jesus is coming soon, we also know it won’t be a day of judgment for us, but of hope.

God is coming, not just to judge but to establish a new world of righteousness, moral perfection, and peace (2 Peter 3:13). God is patiently waiting, not because he’s indifferent but because he wants everyone to repent (2 Peter 3:9). God desires that all people enter his new world where the evil and trauma inflicted by the lusts of others doesn’t exist. God is coming “soon” so that all who experience the toll of sin’s slavery and call to him might repent and find freedom in a coming cosmos made new.

God has made and judged once before, and he will judge and make new once again. Do not discount God’s slowness in human history as disinterest. Count God’s patience as salvation. Count God’s current delay as an invitation for all people. There is an eternal Kingdom coming of grace, power, goodness, and beauty. A day is coming where we will all be freed from the unrighteousness and evil we inflict on others. And that day is coming soon for all who look forward to it.

Peter, one of Jesus’ disciples, reaches out to a community of believers spread throughout Asia Minor—what we now call Turkey (1 Peter 1:1). It’s likely these believers were Gentiles and citizens of the Roman Empire, but Peter calls them “God’s elect exiles.” They are God’s chosen foreigners who have been scattered and dispersed throughout the Empire.

With this word choice Peter intentionally places foreign Gentiles into the story of God’s chosen people, the Jews. Just as God chose Israel, God has elected these Romans. And as the Jews had been scattered by the Babylonian Empire, these believers in Jesus are dispersed through the Roman Empire. But Peter isn’t just comparing similar social and political histories. He’s saying Gentiles are just as chosen by God as Jews. The story of exile and homecoming that is central to Israel’s story is now the story God is writing for all people.

Every believer in Jesus is an exile. No Christian has citizenship in this world because God has chosen to give us a Kingdom in him. Peter adds we’ve been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for both obedience and sprinkling with blood (1 Peter 1:2). Each of those phrases is another way to tie Gentiles into the story of God’s chosen people.

Since Abraham, God knew and chose exiles to bless the world (Genesis 12:1-2). God’s Spirit chose Israel to be his home when he descended into their tabernacle (Exodus 40:34). And the day Israel became a nation, God’s people promised to obey and Moses sprinkled them with blood (Exodus 24:6-7). Just as Israel became a nation when sprinkled in blood, everyone who trusts the blood of Jesus becomes a new nation too.

Where is the Gospel?

God has elected us for exile. We’ve been chosen to be out of place, and that is good news. Peter says our new identity as an exile also means we’re joined to a new family. We’ve died to the nation we’ve been born into, but been born again into an eternal family founded by a loving Father and resurrection life (1 Peter 1:3). And as children of God—and siblings to Jesus—we’re given an inheritance that cannot die, cannot lose to evil, lasts forever, and is guarded by God himself (1 Peter 1:4-5). Foreignness to the world is a reason to rejoice when it means being natives in God’s Kingdom.

And like most outsiders we will suffer for our foreignness. Throughout his letter, Peter will unpack the moral and spiritual “otherness” that comes with following Jesus. But for now Peter reminds us that strangeness to the world is proof of our citizenship in heaven (1 Peter 1:6). Persecution isn’t a reason to despair; trials are a reason to be joyful. We’re no more 

victims

 of persecution than gold is a victim of fire (1 Peter 1:7). We can rejoice because suffering purifies us and demonstrates the authenticity of our faith.

Followers of Jesus will suffer. Jesus certainly did but it led to glory—life from the dead and a throne with God (1 Peter 1:11). And even though we haven’t seen Jesus for ourselves, when we trust and love him, we can rejoice (1 Peter 1:8). Our persecutors never have the last word because our salvation is not something they can harm (1 Peter 1:9). Like Peter said before, no nation or person can kill, corrupt, or erase what God guards for you (1 Peter 1:4-5).

Redemptive suffering and being an elected exile are strange but powerful truths. The prophets in the Old Testament diligently searched the Scriptures trying to figure it out (1 Peter 1:10). And even angels strained to get a glimpse of how God turns suffering to glory and joy (1 Peter 1:12b). But what the prophets and angels struggled to see, we see clearly in Jesus. His suffering led to resurrection and his death led to glory. Because of Jesus, we know that for every believer, suffering and death always lead to a glorious inheritance that lasts forever and will never fade.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has chosen us to be exiles. And may you see Jesus as the one who redeems our suffering and makes us family by his blood and resurrection."

Christian wives, slaves, and citizens are being harmed because of their faithfulness to Jesus. The easy thing to do is retaliate. But Peter says it’s better to suffer for doing good than get even by doing evil (1 Peter 3:17). After all, God’s people are called to be a blessing to the world and not a curse (1 Peter 3:9). Quoting Psalm 34, Peter says that the good life only follows those who turn away from evil (1 Peter 3:10-11). Quoting Jesus, Peter says that those who suffer for righteousness’ sake will be blessed (1 Peter 3:14). Doing good in the context of injustice is the way of Jesus.

By refusing to retaliate towards his accusers, Jesus brings us into the presence of God (1 Peter 3:18). If that’s how we’ve been saved, that’s how we should act towards our accusers (1 Peter 3:15-16). And in the same way that Jesus’ resurrection from the dead shamed the powers of Rome, death, and hell, our gentleness and respect can shame those who slander and persecute us (1 Peter 3:19).

Peter then reminds his people that the conflict between evil spiritual and human powers and God’s people has been going on since the beginning (Genesis 6:4-5). But that conflict always turns out the same way: God saves his own and shames evil. When God sent the flood, it both saved Noah and his family but also shamed the powers (1 Peter 3:20). And just as Noah was saved through the waters of the flood, we are saved through the waters of baptism (1 Peter 3:21). And as the evil people of Noah’s day sunk below the ark, all power and authority have been placed under Jesus’ feet (1 Peter 3:22). Doing good in the context of evil is the way of salvation.

Suffering under evil but being raised in power is the new default worldview for followers of Jesus (1 Peter 4:1). We will be at odds and even persecuted by the people we live alongside (1 Peter 4:4). But the Gospel says even if we die, we will be raised (1 Peter 4:6).

Where is the Gospel?

Suffering for righteousness’ sake is not strange (1 Peter 4:12). Followers of Jesus should expect persecution for living like Jesus. But for the persecuted, Jesus’ unjust death and resurrection isn’t just an example but a precedent. When we suffer like Jesus, we will be raised like him too (1 Peter 4:13). When we suffer for good and not evil, we will never be ashamed (1 Peter 4:15-16). We can fearlessly die to an old, evil, and vengeful way of living because we know we will be raised.

We can also die to our old passions. To the people in Noah’s day, the Gentiles in Peter’s, and our neighbors today, it’s odd to not join in a culture of sex, drinking, and passion (1 Peter 4:3-4a). Not living like our neighbors and living like Jesus carries a social, political, or physical cost. But Peter insists that just as Jesus suffered under our sin and was raised, and just as evildoers sank under the flood and Noah was saved, suffering for doing good leads to resurrection and rescue.

If you live in a country that legislates against Christians, or in a culture that celebrates sensuality and mocks sobriety, or in a world that hates followers of Jesus, resurrection is everywhere. Every persecution confirms our salvation, and every death stores up eternal life (1 Peter 4:1). Christians aren’t victims in a world that doesn’t understand them, but like Jesus, we are victors over every power. That’s why it’s better to suffer for doing good.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who judges justly. And may you see Jesus as the resurrected Savior who suffered for doing good so that we could rise from the dead with him."

James warns leaders responsible for teaching others that they are held to a higher standard (James 3:1). Most people struggle to control what they say, but a teacher’s authority comes from their words. Teachers must prioritize controlling their tongues (James 3:2). If they fail to do this, disaster won’t be far away. James illustrates this warning with several short examples.

Horses, ships, and forest fires are all sent on their course by proportionally small objects. Similarly, a teacher’s tongue directs the life of whole communities. Like a bridle to a horse or a rudder to a ship, their words can guide people into good. But James warns that though the tongue is a small and hidden part of the body, it has all the destructive potential of a spark in dry grass (James 3:3-6). Once lit, it cannot be tamed. And even though humans have tamed every kind of animal, bird, and reptile, the tongue remains an untamable beast (James 3:7-8). Though small, the unrestrained tongue of a teacher wreaks havoc on those in their care.

James also warns teachers that their tongues can be an unnatural evil. As teachers they will likely teach that God is the Good and Supreme Creator. But with that same mouth they’re just as likely to curse and demean the people God created. This shouldn’t be so, and it’s unnatural that it is (James 3:9-10). Fig trees produce figs, and olive trees olives. From salt springs flow salt water, and fresh springs give fresh water (James 3:11-12). But the tongue tends to be unlike anything found in nature. It produces both praises and curses. Teachers must work hard to control their tongues. They must align their mouths with the rest of God’s creation. And in so doing they will consistently bless and encourage those in their care.

Where is the Gospel?

When a teacher’s tongue runs wild, it leaves ruined lives in the wake of its words. Earlier in his letter James stressed that the tongue must be kept in check because only a guarded mouth will keep teachers from ruining themselves and others (James 1:26).

But James is fairly pessimistic about the human ability to control the tongue. Which means only God can restrain the tongue’s burning power. Jesus asked God to do this for his disciples. Jesus wanted God’s Word of Truth to transform their tongues (John 17:17). And God answered Jesus’ prayer. Fifty days after Jesus died, his Holy Spirit came in flaming tongues and rested on his followers, transforming and taming what no person could tame before (Acts 1:14, 2:4). The tongues of Jesus’ followers were recreated, and they taught good news. That began a wildfire of blessing and encouragement to those in their care (Acts 2:6-7).

Ever since that day, the untamable tongue has been no match to the taming power of Jesus. The Holy Spirit is able to harness our tongues so that we can more and more consistently bless others. Obviously we might fail at this. But Jude (brother of James and Jesus) wrote that God is able to keep us from failing and present us before him without fault (Jude 24-25). Jesus won’t let us fall into the restless and unnatural evil that our tongue is capable of. Where the tongue is reckless and unreliable, Jesus is steadfast and true. He always steers his people in the right direction. He bridles even the unruliest of tongues, mastering it to bless God and spread blessing to communities.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who tames the tongue. And may you see Jesus as the one who sends his Spirit to fill you with words of blessing to those in your care."

James, the brother of Jesus, has just called the Bible a “perfect law that gives freedom” (James 1:25). In Israel’s history, God gave Israel laws only after he freed Israel from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 20:2). The law marked the end of an era of slavery, and the beginning of an era of freedom. God’s laws teach God’s people how to be and remain free. To obey is to be free.

And as a people who have been set free, we must look like it. In this letter, James says free people don’t play favorites and free people care for the marginalized (James 1:27; 2:1). To do otherwise is to deny that Jesus has set his people free from slavery. To illustrate, James plays out a story of two strangers entering a church. One is clearly rich and one clearly poor. But the rich man is almost immediately offered a seat of prominence and the poor man is told to sit on the floor (James 2:2-3). But playing favorites this way is to act like there are still slaves in God’s kingdom.

Jesus has specially freed the poor of the world to be the inheritors of his Kingdom (James 2:5). To seat the poor on the floor is to treat them like slaves and to deny the inheritance Jesus has given them. Besides, it’s been the rich who historically oppress and litigate against God’s people (James 2:6). It’s just poor judgment to prefer people who slander the name of Jesus, and discredit his people (James 2:7). And it’s hypocritical to follow a God who became poor only to judge the poor as less deserving of a good seat in God’s church (2 Corinthians 8:9).

Favoritism is not only a denial of our freedom from slavery, but a crime against what James calls the royal law of King Jesus. Jesus told us to love all our neighbors as ourselves (James 2:8). To judge only some as worthy of our care and attention is to become “lawbreakers” in Jesus’ eyes (James 2:9). It doesn’t matter if we’ve kept all the other laws because King Jesus wrote all the Bible’s laws. Each reveals his desire that all people be treated with mercy. To break one law against your neighbor is to break all of them (James 2:10-11). It doesn’t matter if we’re not a murderer, if we continue to show favoritism. We’re still guilty of breaking Jesus’ royal law of mercy. So we should act like people who know that a lack of mercy brings judgment, and mercy towards the marginalized brings freedom (James 2:12-13).

Where is the Gospel?

Often, we think that freedom is the absence of laws that constrain our behavior. If we are restrained we think that means we will never be free to be our true selves. But God’s laws aren’t ultimately restraints. God made us. God’s laws are how God intends us to be our true selves. He made us to be people who don’t play favorites, who are impartial, and who do justice each time we act. So if we follow God’s laws we will be totally free. 

Famously, Jesus summarized all the laws given to Israel down to two: love God with all your heart, and love your neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:30-31). One way to be truly free is to refuse favoritism between the rich and the poor. But more generally, the more we love God and love one another, the more free we become. 

James also called Jesus a “lawgiver.” James says Jesus’ laws can be summarized as “mercy.” Which is really good news for people who want to be maximally free. Because there are no restraints or limits that God places on our pursuit of mercy towards others (Galatians 5:23). So act like your slavery is over. Be free, don’t play favorites, love your neighbor, and show mercy.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who does not play favorites. And may you see Jesus as the one who makes his people free without partiality. "

Earlier in his letter, James has warned us three times that our actions must line up with our beliefs. People who think one thing but do another receive nothing from God (James 1:6-7). Followers of Jesus can’t just listen to God’s words, they must do them (James 1:22). Those who follow the God who became poor, but play favorites with the rich, are hypocrites (James 2:4). Now, James says that belief without corresponding action is a false faith (James 2:14). James isn’t discounting the importance of belief. He assumes a true and vibrant faith in his audience (James 1:3; James 2:1, 5). But James is critiquing a common misconception that faith is just believing the right things. 

So James helps his readers understand what makes faith “real.” Suppose you claim to believe in a God who provides for people’s needs, but when confronted with a hungry and cold member of your community you do nothing but offer thoughts and prayers (James 2:15-16). That’s not real faith but dead platitudes (James 2:17).

But some argue that faith and doing good deeds are just two separate skills. Some people just have more faith than others (James 2:18). But James says you can’t separate faith and its response so easily. True faith doesn’t just produce right action but a loving relationship with God as well. Demons are a good counter-example. Demons have decent theology; they believe that God is one. But that “faith” produces only fear in them, not love (Deuteronomy 6:5-6, James 2:19). According to James, real faith produces both good deeds and a loving relationship with God. 

Abraham is the great example of this type of real faith (James 2:20). It was only after Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son on an altar that God said, “Now I 

know

 you fear God” (Genesis 22:12; James 2:21). While it’s true that we’re told earlier in Abraham’s story that his faith made him God’s friend (Genesis 15:6, James 2:23), it isn’t until after his faith is demonstrated through actions that we’re told God “knows

”

 his faith is real (James 2:22). Abraham, the first follower of God, was saved by faith demonstrated through action (James 2:24). Similarly, Rahab is another example of real faith. She was considered a friend of both God and Israel, but only after her faith placed her home and life on the line to protect two Israeli spies (James 2:25). Both the first Gentile in Canaan and the very first follower of God became God’s friends the same way–by a faith demonstrated through actions. 

Where is the Gospel?

If we have a faith in God that doesn’t produce both good deeds and love for God, it’s not real faith. A faith that is devoid of good deeds and lacks love for God is no more living than a body without a soul (James 2:26). Faith isn’t something we “just believe.” Faith is a life-long embodied and loving response to what God has promised us. God promised Abraham a family. God promised Rahab a home in Israel. But faith in those promises meant nothing unless, in love, they were willing to sacrifice in order to obtain it. Jesus defined following him the same way. If we want Jesus’ promises of resurrection life, we must be willing to sacrifice (Matthew 16:25). Faith isn’t just knowing that Jesus died to free us from our sins and make us God’s friends. Real faith goes beyond our ears into our hearts, and then out into the world. 

This is how we were saved. Jesus did not make us his friends by faith alone. Jesus did not sit in heaven simply believing we would one day be his friends. God did not simply hope the best for us, and trust that one day we would be safe and warm in his Kingdom. No! God so loved us that he took action. He sent his Son, and Jesus willingly gave up his life so that we would be God’s friends forever (John 3:16). Jesus' faith was embodied in a loving, life-long, sacrificial response. God promised to make us his friends, so he saved us by his good deeds.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who saves by faith demonstrated in good deeds. And may you see Jesus as the one who didn’t save by faith alone."

",Website,James Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

James tells teachers in the church they must choose between two kinds of wisdom. One is from earth and the other is from heaven. Earthly wisdom is selfish and leads to disorder. When teachers only look out for themselves it creates a living hell (James 3:15-16). But if teachers are humble and look out for the needs of others, that is the wisdom of heaven. If teachers choose heaven’s wisdom, they can be confident their communities will be full of peace, gentleness, and impartiality (James 3:17-18).

Teachers who prefer earthly wisdom are like generals who fight each other instead of their common enemy (James 4:1). Obsessed with their own desires and goals, teachers like this want to kill each other. They even try to rope God into their disputes and get divine approval for their selfish desires (James 4:2-3). Unsurprisingly, these prayers go unanswered.  

James then changes the metaphor from war to adultery. In a sense, God is married to his church. So when he sees the church’s leaders enmesh themselves so closely with selfish and earthly wisdom, he gets jealous (James 4:4-5). God wants his church and its leaders to marry themselves to his heavenly wisdom alone. And like a loving and patient husband, James says God is willing to take his bride back if they humbly accept God’s wisdom once again (James 4:6).

The teachers and leaders of God’s church must resist the satanic and hellish wisdom of the earth, and humbly submit to the wisdom of heaven (James 4:7). Like a weeping, returning bride, God’s people should return to him and end their affair with earth’s wisdom (James 4:8-9). If the teachers of God’s church are willing to humble themselves, God will restore his relationship with them (James 4:10).

Where is the Gospel?

Throughout his ministry, Jesus lived out the wisdom from heaven and shunned the wisdom of the earth. Jesus urged his quarreling disciples to pursue humility among one another (Luke 22:24, 26). He prayed that they might be united with each other as one (John 17:21). He confronted selfish teachers of the Law (Luke 18:9). He taught them that the path to glory was through humility (Luke 18:14). Jesus also knew the dangers of earthly wisdom. Animated by Satan and obsessed with his own desires, Judas—one of Jesus’ own disciples—killed him (Luke 22:4, 47-48).

But, jealous that his disciples would join themselves to him alone, Jesus died like a humble and selfless husband (Ephesians 5:25-26). He then rose to heaven so that all who humble themselves with him can rise like him. In his wisdom, Jesus has humbly and selflessly given himself to us (Hebrews 2:9). So return to the wisdom of Jesus, especially if you are a leader in God’s church. Turn from combativeness, selfishness, and earthly wisdom. Humble yourselves before the peace-creating, death-reversing wisdom of Jesus. And know that like a good, loving, and patient spouse, Jesus stands ready to restore his relationship with you and answer your prayers once again.

James warns those guilty of slander and unethically gained wealth that God is coming to both judge them for their pride and vindicate those they have harmed.

James tells those quick to slander their neighbors that they aren't just being rude, they are trying to steal an authority that is not theirs (James 4:11). God’s laws forbid lying. Those who intentionally defame someone are really saying God is not the real Lawgiver—they are (James 4:12). But God is the only Judge who has the authority to save and destroy reputations. 

And unlike God, we don’t know what will happen tomorrow. Our lives and perspectives are vanishingly short (James 4:13-14). The universe doesn’t respond to our will, but to God’s alone (James 4:15). God wants us to be humble about our future, just like we are humble before God’s laws. Anything else is arrogance (James 4:16). And God won’t fail to judge and humiliate our presumption and pride (James 4:17). 

James then tells the unethically rich that God's judgment on their pride is coming soon (James 5:1). Their wealth will become moth food and their gold will corrode (James 5:2-3). Those they’ve defrauded have cried out to God, and the God who commands armies in heaven has heard their pleas and stands ready to respond (James 5:4). Their callous disregard for the poor mimics the presumption, greed, and pride that judged and killed Jesus (James 5:6). God stands ready to judge them for their evil (James 5:5). 

Both the slanderous and the unethically rich harm the poor and marginalized. But James says instead of taking matters into their own hands, the poor should be patient like a farmer waiting for his harvest. They should patiently endure the evil of others and wait for God’s justice (James 5:7-8). Or like Job, the poor should endure in hope that their compassionate and merciful God will return everything they have lost (James 5:11; Job 42:12).  

Where is the Gospel?

God’s judgment is scary, but God is a compassionate judge. He hears the cries of the defrauded and returns to the humble all they have lost at the hands of the proud. If that’s the kind of judge God is, we can pray to him (James 5:13-14). Not just for God to act on our behalf, but on behalf of others as well. We can pray for the sick in hopes that God will heal (James 5:14). We can pray for God to judge evil and bring final justice to our losses. Because God is compassionate, the last book of the Bible promises that Jesus is coming soon to rout all evil (Revelation 19:11). 

But Jesus isn’t just coming to judge and destroy but to save (James 2:12). If we’re guilty, we can still ask him to forgive our sins (James 5:15). Yes, Jesus brings justice against the proud. But he is also a compassionate judge who is willing to pardon those guilty of the same pride, slander, and unethical wealth that killed him (James 5:19-20). There is no one so far gone that he is not willing to forgive. If you confess your pride and pray to Jesus, God will judge you. But he will judge you as humble. And you can be confident that all of the judgment that would have been yours, is forever canceled. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is a compassionate Judge. And may you see Jesus as the one who hears our prayers for both justice and forgiveness. "

",Website,James Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The author of the letter of James is Jesus’ brother. While his brother was alive, James thought Jesus and his teachings were insane (Mark 3:21). But now James recounts the teachings of Jesus in the style of the book of Proverbs from the Hebrew Bible. James has gone from seeing his brother as crazy, to casting him as the wisest man in the world’s history. 

James’ letter is addressed to the “twelve tribes in the Dispersion” (James 1:1). It’s both a nod to the twelve tribes of Israel that were exiled to Babylon, and a reference to Jesus’ twelve disciples who now make disciples of Jesus’ wisdom throughout the world (Matthew 28:19-20). James is writing to all followers of the wisdom and teaching of Jesus no matter where they’re from.

The wisdom of Jesus, from the mouth of James, begins with acknowledging that life is a complex set of trials designed to produce genuine faith that endures suffering well (James 1:2-3). That’s because the wisdom of Jesus is that after suffering, humiliation, and death there is always resurrection. When we endure trials we can be confident they will make us mature, whole, and complete (James 1:4). As followers of Jesus, we should embrace this wisdom with joy, even if it’s difficult to accept. 

But God will generously give the wisdom that death comes before life to everyone who wholeheartedly asks (James 1:5-8). Those who are currently being raised from their humiliation can celebrate that they are living proof of Jesus’ resurrection wisdom (James 1:9). And those who are currently being humiliated can celebrate too. Their lives might be as burnt and dead as grass in late summer, but God promises restoration and life if they endure their trial (James 1:10-12).

When trials are intense we’re tempted to cope by indulging our darker desires, and then blame God for setting us up to fail. But God is too good to be tempted or to tempt us to fail (James 1:13). God desires disaster for no one. Our desires are just that—ours (James 1:14). God might test us, but his tests are not meant to kill. They’re designed to give us life (James 1:18). We are tempted by our own deadly indulgences because God only does good to his people (James 1:15-17).

Where is the Gospel?

In Jesus, suffering guarantees resurrection. We don’t need to indulge, binge, or self-medicate our way out of suffering because Jesus has chosen suffering as the way we grow, mature, and live forever. Before we die, we will suffer. And we will be tempted to blame God for the darkness in us that suffering reveals. But those moments are designed by God to give us life. In those moments we must choose to not simply hear the wisdom of Jesus’s suffering and resurrection, but act as if it's true (James 1:22). We must accept our humiliation, our poverty, or our suffering. We must refuse to blame God. We must endure because we know God will raise us up. 

If we fail to endure, we will be proven fools—dumber than people who see their face in a mirror and immediately forget what they look like (James 1:24). But if we see the cross and resurrection of Jesus as wisdom, and endure in those truths, we will be proven wise. We will be given the same wholeness, maturity, and resurrection Jesus was given (James 1:25). 

Followers of Jesus can’t just “believe” the good news that Jesus was raised from the dead; we must also be willing to live it out. With joy, we must accept the humiliation that suffering brings, if we want to celebrate being raised. So, fix your eyes on Jesus who matures and perfects our faith through trials. In joy, Jesus endured the humiliation of his cross and is now seated on God’s right hand (Hebrew 12:2). And if you see and don't forget Jesus, your life will soon mirror his.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who only gives you good things. And may you see Jesus and his teachings as the only wise way to be raised out of your humiliation. "

Peter ends his first letter with two final encouragements. The first is for the leaders, or the elders, of his churches scattered throughout Asia Minor. Like them, Peter is also a church leader and has suffered for it (1 Peter 5:1). But Peter encourages the leaders with the same truth he gave their members—suffering leads to glory. These leaders should shepherd their little flocks with a willingness to be living examples of Jesus’ sacrificial and righteous life, regardless of the cost (1 Peter 5:2-3).Jesus proved that willingly leading into and serving through suffering is the way to glory (1 Peter 5:4).

Both the necessity of suffering and the image of church leaders as shepherds are deeply tied to Peter’s personal experience with Jesus. Peter infamously rebukes Jesus for saying he must suffer, and Jesus responds by calling him Satan (Matthew 16:23). Denying the necessity of suffering is a Satanic lie. And after denying Jesus three times, Jesus calls Peter to church leadership by repeating the phrase, “Feed my lambs,” three times (John 21:15). Peter’s encouragements for leaders to shepherd the lambs of God’s church and willingly suffer come from his deepest failure as a follower of Jesus.

These moments also inform Peter’s encouragement to the younger members of these churches. Peter’s arrogance about suffering meant God opposed him to his face, so he reminds younger believers that “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble'' (1 Peter 5:5). To young people itching to lead, Peter reminds them that it was only once he was humiliated and humbly submitted to Jesus that he was given a position of authority (John 21:15). Humility and suffering are never wasted. God’s strong arm raised Jesus from the humiliation of death, and will certainly care for all believers in their anxiety and persecution (1 Peter 5:6-7).

Peter warns that humility doesn’t mean being stupid. Satan is hunting them with both persecution and the lie that suffering can be avoided (1 Peter 5:8). Peter doesn’t want his disciples to repeat his mistakes. These churches must resist the devil with the knowledge that suffering is inevitable for followers of the crucified Jesus. But so is their coming eternal glory (1 Peter 5:9-10).

Peter ends his letter by saying that he’s writing from Babylon (1 Peter 5:13). Babylon was an ancient city in Israel’s history. By Peter’s day it had been destroyed but had become an archetype of a society opposed to God’s people. It’s a final reminder that these believers, regardless of their nationality, will always be exiles. Followers of Jesus are always foreigners, and like many foreigners, they will be hated for it.

Where is the Gospel?

The inevitability of suffering for our faith in Jesus is hard to accept, much less lead our churches in, or be encouraged by it. But for most followers of Jesus around the world and throughout history, the option 

not

 to suffer has never been given to them. Peter doesn’t assume that life should be devoid of suffering, but instead argues that the blessed life rises up through suffering. For followers of Jesus the inevitability of suffering is good news because that means glory, blessing, honor, and power are inevitable too. After we have suffered for a little while, Peter says, the God of all grace will restore, make us strong, firm, and eternally established in his power (1 Peter 5:10-11).

Persecution by governments, families, and friends can often elicit anger and resentment. But Peter wants your first response to be joy. When Peter was confronted and flogged for preaching about Jesus, he left rejoicing that he was counted worthy of suffering for the name of Jesus (Acts 5:41). That’s not because Peter was brave and a beating didn’t scare him. (Remember, he denied Jesus!) Peter can rejoice because suffering for the name, spiritually and physically, joins him to Jesus and his coming resurrection (1 Peter 5:10).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to the God who suffered and died. And may you see Jesus as the one who guarantees our inevitable resurrection when we suffer with him."

By God's Word and Son, we are imperishable and undying.",Website,1 Peter Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Peter opens his letter with good news. His Gentile audience that was once outside God’s people has now been chosen by God (1 Peter 1:1). These strangers are adopted and reborn into God’s family (1 Peter 1:3). But this salvation, guaranteed by Jesus and his sufferings, isn’t fully here yet. For now, God’s chosen people must wait in exile (1 Peter 1:5). So Peter tells his people to get ready.

Like Israel preparing to leave Egypt and enter their new home, these believers need to “gird their loins” as they march to their new country (1 Peter 1:13a; Exodus 11:12). For Peter, this means both behaving a certain way and holding onto a Jesus-centered hope. God’s people put aside the passions and preferences of their old kingdom, and put on the holiness demanded of God’s Kingdom (1 Peter 1:15). Getting ready also means God’s people set their hope fully on all the good news Jesus will bring to pass (1 Peter 1:13). Both trusting King Jesus and acting like a citizen of God’s Kingdom is how we prepare to enter our new country.

But the life of a foreigner is also a life of fear (1 Peter 1:17). Not a fear of being persecuted or being different (although that is a reality), but a fear born of knowing what citizenship in God’s Kingdom costs. God’s people are not rescued with something trivial like gold or silver, but by the precious blood of Jesus (1 Peter 1:18-19). Israel walked out of Egypt only after they walked under doorposts painted with blood (Exodus 12:7). And on the way to their new home both Jews and Gentiles must pass under the shadow of a bloody cross. Citizens of God’s Kingdom are called to sacrificially love like their Savior, and to put away the type of evil that nailed Jesus to the cross (1 Peter 1:22; 2:1). All believers must leave behind old behaviors in fear of dishonoring what God has done for them—and look forward to a different hope.

God has known “since forever ago” that he would die to rescue his people (1 Peter 1:20). In Jesus we know that God has bent the timeline of eternity and sacrificed his body for the benefit of his people. That’s our hope. That’s why we fear. That’s why we must act like citizens of God’s Kingdom as we wait for his return.

Where is the Gospel?

Waiting in exile as a foreigner is hard. Being alienated and persecuted for your allegiance to Jesus, even more so. But Peter goes on to say that we have been born again by the undying and imperishable Word of God (1 Peter 1:23). He quotes from the prophet Isaiah who said God’s Word would outlast the most powerful nation of his day—Babylon (Peter 1:24). And in Jesus it has! Neither Babylon nor Rome could stop God from keeping his Word. From eternity past God has chosen a people to save by choosing his Son, the Word made Flesh, as King (John 1:14).

No country can stop God. And Jesus’ resurrection has repatriated us into a Kingdom where death is dead. By God’s Word and Son, we are imperishable and undying. And that hope of being included in an eternal Kingdom should motivate us to act like that Kingdom has already come.

In a very abrupt change of metaphor, Peter tells us to act like babies craving milk (1 Peter 2:2). Milk is what matures a child. And Peter says that the way children of God mature into their citizenship is by continually craving the good news of what Jesus has done for us. Jesus is like a breast-feeding mother, continually giving of himself for the sake of his children. And like children, we grow when we go back, over and over, to the one who saves and provides.

Often we think the way we leave behind our old behaviors, say no to our sin, and hope in our coming resurrection is by scrunching up our faces, doing more, and trying harder. But Peter says maturing as God’s child is as simple as drinking, eating, and trusting what God has done for us in Jesus.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has chosen us to be his people. And may you see Jesus as the one who both saves us and makes us holy."

In the book of Exodus God tells his people that if they obey him, they will be his treasured possession and a kingdom of priests set apart to bless the world (Exodus 19:5-6). Peter picks up on God’s ancient calling and applies it, not only to Israel, but to everyone who has faith in Jesus. And Peter adds that we aren’t only royal priests and treasured possessions, we're also living stones building a new temple (1 Peter 2:4-5a). In Israel, the temple was a building where people offered sacrifices and met God. But now the temple is a spiritual reality where we have been set apart, like Israel, as new priests, to sacrifice our lives and our actions for the blessing of others (1 Peter 2:5b).

This new growing and global temple began with Jesus. He’s the cornerstone. Without his sacrifice and his example, God’s new plan to bless the world through his people crumbles (1 Peter 2:6). Peter says we are “living stones” who comprise a new meeting place with God that mediates blessing as we live holy lives.

But this living temple we’re building with God is built through rejection (1 Peter 2:7). Jesus was our temple, priest, and sacrifice all in one—and he was killed for it (1 Peter 2:8). As new, chosen temples and royal priests of Jesus, we’ll run afoul of our current religious systems. As God’s precious possession called into the light, the darkness will hate us for telling everyone about it (1 Peter 2:9). So, to be chosen by God means to be exiles and strangers (1 Peter 2:11a). Being God's precious ones means being rejected by the world, like our cornerstone was.

But that’s as it should be. Citizens of a holy Kingdom resist the passions and desires of our old earthly nations (1 Peter 2:11). And while that will bring persecution and even death, Jesus shows us that living as natives of God’s Kingdom rather than citizens of our own brings life from the dead (1 Peter 2:12).

Peter then gives three examples of how this spiritual reality plays out in real life. His examples are a Christian citizen confronted by Roman authority, a Christian slave at odds with his unbelieving master, and a believing wife estranged from her pagan husband. As priests, citizens, and temples of God’s Kingdom, they are exiles and foreigners in their nation, work, and marriages. Peter knows each will suffer ridicule, suffering, and estrangement. But Peter is hopeful that the sacrificial lives of God’s new chosen people will bless the world.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus’ suffering and rejection led to his resurrection and our salvation. Jesus’ exile as our Temple, Priest, and God’s treasured Son means that the whole world is blessed. Peter knows marriages will resurrect (1 Peter 3:1), masters will repent to their slaves, and governments will bow when the chosen exiles of God refuse to act like citizens of the world, but instead follow the example of Jesus.

Even though Jesus lived as a subject of Rome and died by the Pharisees’ accusation, he rose from the dead because he lived obedient to God—and so silenced Rome’s power and the Pharisees’ lies (1 Peter 2:15). And when Jesus suffered and was beaten like a slave, he didn’t hate his persecutors, but offered forgiveness like a priest (1 Peter 2:22-23)! By his faithfulness and sacrifice slaves are made righteous and healed from their scars (1 Peter 2:24). And just as Jesus died to save and make pure his bride, believing wives can win over their husbands by their gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:1).

Jesus is our example (1 Peter 2:21). Jesus shows us that when God’s people sacrificially behave like chosen exiles, royal priests, and treasured people, the world is blessed, our persecutors are transformed, and we will rise from our humiliation.

The apostle Peter is on his deathbed (2 Peter 1:14). And 2 Peter contains the last words of one of Jesus’ closest disciples. He begins by saying that Jesus is our God and Savior (2 Peter 1:1). Many in Peter’s day denied these claims and their implications, and Peter will address these false teachers later in his letter. For now, Peter just wants to preach one last sermon before he dies.

And the point of his sermon is that Jesus has leveraged his divine power to give us everything we need to live a godly life—and that godly life comes through knowing Jesus (2 Peter 1:3). Knowing that Jesus is our God and Savior isn’t simply knowing a fact about Jesus, but participating in God’s divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). Peter means we share, commune, and are filled with the moral virtue or righteousness of God. He says this participation in the divine is God making good on his promises. Peter never explains what those promises are precisely, but he does explain what they do. God’s promises join us to his morally perfect divine nature and we escape corruption (2 Peter 1:4b).

Moral corruption poisons our planet. Our relationships with one another and God are often marked by ignorance, a lack of self-control, fickleness, animosity, and hate. But Jesus calls us into his glorious righteousness, and by his divine power we share his moral perfection. In Jesus we escape our moral corruption.

But this escape is both an event and a journey. Jesus saves us by faith, but we must also make every effort to add moral virtue to our faithfulness (2 Peter 1:5a). God leverages his divine power to add us into his perfect wisdom, self-control, loyalty, affection, and love (2 Peter 1:5b-7). In response to the event of God’s inclusion of his people in his moral perfection, we participate in the divine by living into a journey of increasing moral virtue and godliness (2 Peter 1:8). Those who know Jesus as God and Savior are always growing in this way (2 Peter 1:10).

The good news Peter takes to the grave is that Jesus saves us to participate in his divine moral perfection, and live like him on the earth. The unvirtuous, undisciplined, and unloving have forgotten why they have been saved (2 Peter 1:9). But those who participate in the divine will experience increasing confidence in their salvation and increasing godliness in their lives.

Where is the Gospel?

As Peter dies, he knows that participation in Jesus’ divine nature both saves us from our moral corruption and saves us to make moral progress as we live. But Peter’s hope stretches beyond this life. Participating in the divine doesn’t just mean becoming more and more righteous over time; it means participating in the divine’s immortality too. Jesus has joined himself to us, but he will also welcome us into an eternal Kingdom (2 Peter 1:11). At the end of his letter Peter adds that Jesus will welcome us to a new reality where righteousness will finally dwell (2 Peter 3:13).

At the end of Peter’s life, he leaves us with his sermon that our righteous Savior shares his righteous nature with us so we can live righteous lives that will lead to eternal righteousness. The moral corruption that’s universal now will disappear and our moral progress will give way to moral perfection forever.

An eternal reality dominated by our moral corruption is called hell. But Peter says those who know Jesus will experience now and forever righteousness. So trust the Righteous One Peter praises with his last pen strokes. Trust that Jesus will call you to all of his glory and excellence. Trust that Jesus can pull you out of your moral corruption and into eternal moral perfection.

Peter is on the attack. False teachers have accused him of teaching the myth that Jesus will return to judge their sexuality and greed (2 Peter 2:2-3a). This false teaching denies Jesus’ authority to rule and denies a coming day of judgment—and so denies that Christians are obligated to any one moral code. In other words, if God isn’t going to judge, we can do what we want (2 Peter 2:19). But Peter attacks each of these assumptions.

First, and with regard to Jesus’ authority, Peter says it’s no myth that he and the other apostles are eyewitnesses to Jesus’ transfiguration (2 Peter 1:16). Jesus’ transfiguration in the Gospels is the moment when the apostles realize Jesus has the authority to rule the world. God speaks from heaven that Jesus is his coronated Son (Matthew 17:5). And he’s joined by Moses, Israel’s first king, and Elijah the Restorer, the first person in the Bible to raise someone from the dead (Matthew 17:11). The false teachers are wrong. The transfiguration reveals that Jesus has been given authority over life, death and the universe—and Peter is a witness.

Second, Peter proves a coming day of judgment. Part of the false teachers’ argument was that the idea of a prophesied day of judgment was man’s invention, not God’s (2 Peter 1:20). “Judgment” is a tool used by the religious to force moral control through fear. But Peter says prophecies of judgment are not man-made constructs, but a product of the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:21). The idea that there is no coming judgment is man-made, and in fact this objection has also been prophesied by the Holy Spirit they deny (2 Peter 2:1).

This denial of inevitable judgment is ancient and has consequences (2 Peter 2:3). Peter proves this with three famous stories of judgment from the Old Testament: the fall of the sons of God, Noah’s flood, and Sodom and Gomorrah. In these stories, angelic beings, Noah’s contemporaries, and the citizens of the twin cities all reject God’s moral authority, indulge in their sexual and material lusts, and become examples of what will happen to 

all

 the ungodly (2 Peter 2:6).

Finally, Peter addresses the false teachers’ claims about morality by pairing the inevitable judgment of the ungodly with the inevitable rescue of the morally righteous. Noah and Lot were both righteous men, grieved by the moral and spiritual evil around them, and they were both saved (2 Peter 2:5, 7-8). Righteousness matters. In denying that Jesus will return and in promoting an anything-goes morality, these false teachers aren’t just denying Scripture. They’re also denying any rescue from a world of evil (2 Peter 2:9-10).

Peter calls this type of thinking animalistic (2 Peter 2:12). These false teachers slouch from appetite to appetite, barking about things they refuse to understand (2 Peter 2:14). Driven by money, they’re like Balaam, an old prophet who sold his incantations to the highest bidder and whose animal was more sane than his master (2 Peter 2:15-16). Like a waterless spring, preaching so-called freedom while denying Jesus’ coming is useless at best, and inhuman at worst (2 Peter 2:17-18). So afraid of God’s authority, they enslave themselves to their own primal passions (2 Peter 2:19-20). And like dogs and pigs, they can’t help but eat their own filth (2 Peter 2:22).

Where is the Gospel?

Peter is on the attack—and you can tell. He’s speaking to us by speaking against these false teachers. Some of us might need to hear Peter’s harsh rebuke about the inevitability of judgment. Others may share the false teacher’s skepticism about Jesus’ coming and are intrigued by a less morally rigorous faith (2 Peter 2:18). Some of you need to hear Peter’s warning about the inevitable implosion of a life ruled by your appetites, and submit to a Ruler other than yourself.

But all of us need to hear the good news that rescue and deliverance are inevitable for the righteous. Peter has already said that those who know Jesus share his righteous divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). Our rescue is secure! Like Noah, we can boldly preach righteousness to a world going under (2 Peter 2:5). Like Lot, we can weep over a world lost in its debauchery (2 Peter 2:8). And like both of them, we can be confident that the closest we will come to experiencing judgment is reading about it (2 Peter 2:9). God has a history of saving the righteous, and he will do it for all of us who know and trust his Son, the King, Jesus.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who judges evil. And may you see Jesus as the one who rules the world and saves the righteous from judgment."

We also see that Jesus’ second coming isn’t something to be feared but to be hoped for.",Website,1 & 2 Timothy Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Paul is about to die (2 Timothy 4:6). But he knows God will reward him for a life of faithful work (2 Timothy 4:8). As Paul ends his race, he encourages Timothy to take his baton and continue the ministry he began in hopes of Timothy’s own reward. 

He solemnly calls both God and Jesus to be his witnesses, as he charges Timothy to continue his race (2 Timothy 4:1a). To Paul, God is coming to judge and the Kingdom of Jesus is coming soon (2 Timothy 4:1b). The quick coming of God should encourage Timothy to quickly accept Paul’s charge. 

But false teachers in Ephesus deny that Jesus will come to judge at all (2 Timothy 2:18). And complacent followers of Jesus, looking for ways to justify their immoral desires, are drawn to this convenient myth (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Timothy needs to be on call immediately to correct this false teaching, despite the suffering Paul knows it will entail (2 Timothy 4:2, 5). 

In fact, Timothy should be motivated to accept this calling by the very doctrine these false teachers deny. Jesus is coming! Paul knows his race is ending and that he’s run it well (2 Timothy 4:7). And he also knows that when Jesus comes to judge, Paul will receive a reward (2 Timothy 4:8a). Paul compares this reward to a crown given to the winner of a race. But unlike the one crown athletes compete for, God awards crowns to everyone who patiently looks forward to Jesus’ coming (2 Timothy 4:8). False teachers don’t need to deny God’s coming judgment. Instead, like Timothy, they can look forward to the promise of being rewarded for a life of faithfulness. 

None of this diminishes the costliness of this message. Paul is alone. His co-workers and friends have all either abandoned the ministry or are currently deployed (2 Timothy 4:10b, 12). Paul’s former partner, Alexander, actively seeks Paul and Timothy’s harm (2 Timothy 4:14-15). And currently on trial for preaching about Jesus, Paul has no one to support him (2 Timothy 4:16). But Paul also knows God is with him in his suffering. Like the prophet Daniel was rescued from the jaws of lions and then rewarded by King Darius for his faithfulness (Daniel 6:23, 28), Paul knows God will deliver him from the maw of Rome into a heavenly Kingdom and his eternal reward (2 Timothy 4:17-18). 

Where is the Gospel?

In Jesus' first coming, he lived a hard life, was abandoned by his friends, and suffered a painful death for us (Isaiah 53:3). But Jesus’ faithfulness to God was rewarded with life from the dead (Acts 2:24). And now Jesus wears a crown and judges the world as God’s Universal Sovereign (Ephesians 1:21). But Jesus’ authority as a Judge isn’t something to fear or deny because everyone who looks forward to Jesus’ second coming will be rewarded! 

Everyone who suffers in hope of Jesus’ comfort will be given it. Everyone who works in hope of God’s approval will get it (Matthew 25:23). Everyone who throws their guilt on Jesus’ cross will be forgiven. And everyone who dies in the hope of Jesus’ empty tomb will be resurrected (John 11:25). Jesus is coming again. So like Timothy, take Paul’s last written words seriously. You too are Paul’s successor. You too have been given a race to run and a ministry to accomplish. Faithfulness will cost you but the Lord crowns all who endure in hope until he comes again.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open up your eyes to see the God who is coming again. And may you see Jesus as the one who shows us that there is always a crown and reward for those who love and hope for his return. "

Since the Garden of Eden people have been deceived by evil spirits. Jesus warned the lies of demons would be a feature of life on earth (1 Timothy 4:1; Matthew 24:24). So the apostle Paul tells Timothy to persevere and endure. 

Perhaps appealing to the creation story, a new group of teachers forbid marriage and certain types of food (1 Timothy 4:3a). But Paul says all of these doctrines are nothing but myths (1 Timothy 4:7). God created the world to be received with joy, not abstained from in skepticism (1 Timothy 4:3b). Everything God makes is good and worth receiving and being thankful for (1 Timothy 4:4-5). The physical denial and training these teachers demand aren’t worth comparing to true godliness and the eternal life it promises (1 Timothy 4:7-8). Timothy must persevere, labor, and make every effort to feed himself on the truths of Scripture and the good news of Jesus alone (1 Timothy 4:6). The only hope for a world dying under the weight of its myths is the news that there is a living God who is the Savior of all people (1 Timothy 4:10).  

Paul then turns his attention away from the false teachers and onto Timothy and his teaching (1 Timothy 4:11). Despite what his opponents say, Timothy’s youth doesn’t disqualify him from leadership. Timothy should continue to lead as an example in faith, love, and purity (1 Timothy 4:12). Timothy should also persevere by publicly reading, encouraging, and teaching through Scripture despite opposition (1 Timothy 4:13, 15). Through being diligent to guard his character and endure in teaching Scripture, Timothy will save both himself and his church from the false teachers' lies (1 Timothy 4:16). 

Where is the Gospel?

It’s easy to undervalue endurance. Making small, private steps towards purity, faith, and love seems inconsequential when you’re being publicly slandered. Preaching one more sermon on a Sunday while your people are endlessly telegraphed lies through the Internet seems pointless. But Paul tells us perseverance in godliness and truth saves.

The lies of demons and the myths the powerful told amongst themselves incited mobs that eventually lynched Jesus (Luke 23:21-23). But Jesus persevered. He did not respond to cruelty with cruelty. He did not respond to godlessness with anger. But like a willing sheep led to a slaughter, he died as a sacrifice for the demonically agitated and godless (Isaiah 53:7). But through his perseverance Jesus saved both himself and his Church. Jesus is the living God who died, was raised, lives forever, and who is able to save all people (1 Timothy 4:10). Jesus is the only Truth that matters (John 14:26). 

Jesus told his disciples that if they persevere in him and if they allow his Spirit of Truth to fill them, he will tell them “what is to come” (John 16:13). And what’s to come is 

salvation

 for everyone who endures in godliness and truth (1 Timothy 4:10) both salvation from the evil lies that have swirled since the Garden of Eden and salvation into an eternal life where there is only truth—and where lies are silenced forever. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is the Truth. And may you see Jesus as the one who endured the cross to save his people from the presence and power of lies. "

A group of false teachers are twisting God’s Word to say that Jesus’ final return to earth has already happened (2 Timothy 2:18). These teachings have eroded the church’s willingness to engage in suffering and do good works (2 Timothy 2:21b). Paul calls this teaching silly, babbling, and ignorant (2 Timothy 2:16a, 23). Like gangrene forces amputation, this teaching is a progressive infection that will ruin those who listen to it (2 Timothy 2:14). But Timothy shouldn’t be discouraged. False teachers have always been around, and the solution is always the same: to handle, interpret, and explain God’s Word (2 Timothy 1:15).

And by way of example, Paul compares Timothy to an embattled Moses. Quoting from the book of Numbers, Paul reminds Timothy of a leader named Korah who disagreed with God’s word which granted Moses authority to lead (Numbers 16:3). But God’s word vindicated Moses’ leadership, amputated the rebels from the community of Israel, and revealed those who truly listened to God (Numbers 16:5). Korah’s rebellion didn’t destroy Israel but cleansed it. Timothy can be confident that his leadership will be vindicated and his people will be purified as he stands on God’s Word (2 Timothy 2:19).

Paul then makes the same point by way of analogy. Timothy is like the fine china of an impressive estate: useful to his Owner for the special purpose he’s been chosen for (2 Timothy 2:20). Timothy has been chosen to clean God’s house and he must deal with these false teachers as God’s Word demands he should (2 Timothy 2:21). First, by refusing to argue with them on their terms (2 Timothy 2:23). And second, by being kind, gentle, and patient with them (2 Timothy 2:23-24). Paul is confident that this gentle correction towards listening to God’s Word will rescue those trapped by the lies they teach (2 Timothy 2:25-26). 

This will be difficult for Timothy (2 Timothy 3:1). The selfishness and arrogance of others won’t end soon (2 Timothy 3:2-4). He will always face people who claim Jesus on their own terms while denying he has the power to tell them how to behave (2 Timothy 3:5). Like the two Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses, false teachers will 

never not

 oppose the Word of God that sets his people free from their sin (2 Timothy 3:13). 

But Paul reminds Timothy that he has been a faithful companion through worse trials (2 Timothy 3:10-11). In fact, Timothy has been faithful to follow the teachings of Scripture since he was a boy (2 Timothy 3:14-15). And the same Scripture that made him into the man he is now will be the same Scripture that will train, correct, and make his church ready to do good works (2 Timothy 3:16-17).

Where is the Gospel?

Twice Paul compares Timothy to an embattled Moses. And twice Paul reminds Timothy that faithfulness to God’s Word is the solution to that opposition. The good news for followers of Jesus surrounded by opposition to God’s Church, selfishness, and false teaching is the ultimate victory of the Word of God. God’s Word is God’s very breath (2 Timothy 3:16). And when faithful men and women teach God’s Word, God’s breath breathes new life into embattled churches, families, and people in need of equipping. God’s Word is powerful to do what we need (Hebrews 4:12)! 

And God’s Word also became human (John 1:14). Jesus was filled with God’s very breath. And Jesus was opposed by the forces of the Roman government, selfish religion, and death, yet he was victorious over them all (Colossians 2:15). Jesus’ resurrection proves the undying power of God’s Word. There are no real threats to the stability of God’s house or the foundation of his Church (Matthew 16:18). And now the Word of God doesn’t just live on a page for us to read, it lives in us by God’s Spirit (John 20:22). We are filled with the breath of God, able to discern truth and apply God’s Word every time we face opposition (John 16:13). 

So don’t be discouraged by the constant attacks against God’s Church. God’s Word has conquered death. God’s Word fills us. And we are equipped for every challenge and every good work.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who speaks. And may you see Jesus as God’s Word made flesh who now lives in you. "

Certain leaders inside the church of Colossae doubt that the apostle Paul has told them the whole truth. They’ve begun teaching that in addition to trusting Jesus, other spiritual practices are needed to experience the fullness of God (Colossians 2:4). Concerned, Epaphras, the founder of the Colossian church, visits an imprisoned Paul for advice. He tells Paul about all the good he sees in their church, but also the teaching his leaders are spreading (Colossians 1:7-8). The letter of Colossians is Paul’s response.

But before he engages the problems of Colossae, Paul emphasizes the full picture of what God has done for them. Paul thanks God for the Colossians’ faith (Colossians 1:3). They are faithful, loving, and hopeful in the good news that Jesus died, rose, and will return soon (Colossians 1:4-5). And rather than filling their lives with new ways to please God, Paul prays that the Colossians will be full of God’s Holy Spirit (Colossians 1:9). Full of God’s power, Paul is also confident they will live lives that fully please God (Colossians 1:10-11). 

Instead of experimenting with fullness elsewhere, the Colossians should remember and be thankful that Jesus is King. Jesus has rescued them from a kingdom of darkness and promised that the Colossians are the rightful inheritors of his eternal Kingdom of light (Colossians 1:12-13). King Jesus has also pardoned their past misdeeds (Colossians 1:14). So far, the Colossians have done nothing to fully experience what King Jesus offers, and they don’t need to start now. 

Instead of experimenting with alternative ways to be full, the Colossians should also remember that Jesus is a creator with authority. He is the rightful heir and ruler of all created things (Colossians 1:15). Jesus created the sky and the land. Jesus created both political and spiritual powers, and all authorities in heaven and earth work for him (Colossians 1:16). Jesus has authority over all living things, and his resurrection proves his authority extends even over death (Colossians 1:18). Jesus is the Supreme of the universe, and through his blood and cross he has joined his once-alienated creation to the fullness of his creative power (Colossians 1:19-20). 

Contrary to the claims of some, the fullness of God’s authority and power has been offered freely. The Colossians already know this because they also know they used to be God’s enemies (Colossians 1:21). They know Jesus used his authority to cancel their past treasons, and they know God’s Spirit has fully empowered them to please God (Colossians 1:22). This is the only teaching that offers fullness, and it’s only by remaining in this teaching that the Colossians will please God (Colossians 1:23).

Where is the Gospel?

Paul understands that his job as an apostle is to first fully explain the message of Jesus (Colossians 1:24-25); specifically, the good news that the fullness of God now lives inside all people who trust him (Colossians 1:27). Paul’s job is to explain there are no extra steps, no moral actions, and no religious activities that will give us more of God than we have right now through Jesus. 

Paul says his second job is related, which is to encourage those who have the fullness of God to mature into that identity and live lives that please God (Colossians 1:28-29). 

But that maturity doesn’t come the way we might expect. The Colossian teachers assumed true maturity implied something more than simply trusting in Jesus. But Paul’s point in the entire first chapter of Colossians is that you can’t mature past an eternal Jesus. You can’t go beyond the Holy Spirit who lives inside of you. Followers of Jesus don’t mature past the Gospel.

As King, Jesus has pardoned our misdeeds and given us a Kingdom of light to rule. As Creator, Jesus has joined his creatures to the fullness of his creative power. As the Ruler of Death he gave resurrection. So, take Paul’s advice. Don’t move past the Gospel. Instead, thank God that you will experience the fullness of Jesus more deeply over time. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has sent us Jesus. And may you see Jesus as the one who has done everything to give us the fullness of God.

The apostle Paul has just told the Colossians that they are made newly alive by Jesus (Colossians 3:9-10). They are filled with God’s power and freed from the powers and motivations that used to control them (Colossians 2:8-9). But this freedom hasn’t changed their social, marital, and institutional situations. These believers are still married, they still have children, and some are even slaves and slave masters. But Paul tells them that these household relationships are opportunities to demonstrate the transforming power of Jesus to the Roman world they lived in.

Wives shouldn’t use their freedom in Jesus as an excuse to leave, reject, or rebel against their current husbands, but to remain loyal to them (Colossians 3:18). Husbands shouldn’t freely use their wives to satisfy their desires, but love their wives and consider their wives’ desires as more significant than their own (Colossians 3:19). Children shouldn't use their freedom in Jesus as an excuse to disobey their parents, but to obey them more quickly (Colossians 3:20). Parents should mimic their heavenly Father and use their authority to encourage their children (Colossians 3:21). And slaves who could demand their freedom because of Jesus, should instead obey their masters—not to please them, but to please the God who makes slaves inheritors of his Kingdom (Colossians 3:22-24). God doesn’t show favoritism to either slaves or masters. So slave masters should remember they have the same Master as those they employ (Colossians 4:1). They are not superior to their slaves and they will be judged if they fail to treat those in their employment with equity and justice (Colossians 3:25). 

Paul wants the Colossians’ homes to be public pictures of the Gospel. But Paul knows living like Jesus in marriages, as children, and when in service to others, will be difficult. It will require prayer and thankfulness (Colossians 4:2). These are the lessons Paul learned in prison, and still needs to heed himself (Colossians 4:3-4). They all need prayer to endure difficult circumstances. And they all must remain hopeful and thankful that God works through families and homes to demonstrate the power of Jesus and his ability to free the world (Colossians 4:5-6).

Where is the Gospel?

The most significant relationships in our lives provide some of the greatest opportunities to demonstrate the love and power of Jesus to the world. As wives express loyalty to husbands who sacrifice for them, together they become a living picture of the Church and Jesus’ self-dying love (Ephesians 5:24-25). As children obey their parents, they mirror the obedience of Jesus to his Father (John 5:19). As parents patiently teach their children, they display God’s patience to a disobedient world (Romans 2:4). Those who serve others will embody Jesus’ sacrificial service that saves us (Philippians 2:7-8). And godly employers mirror the way God uses his authority to do justice. Marriage, childhood, parenting, and work exist (in part) to publicly picture the good news of Jesus.

But these relationships aren’t just demonstrations of Jesus’ power and love; they are ways to participate in it. As we love those in relationship to us, we give and receive the love of God (Matthew 25:40). Marriages, families, and work are sacred places where we come face-to-face with Jesus. At different times, Scripture describes Jesus as a husband, a son, a father, a brother, a slave, and a master. Jesus even describes himself like a mother, a mother hen who wants to protect her chicks (Luke 13:34). Marriages, families, and workplaces are some of the most vivid expressions of God’s love we will experience. When we sacrifice, love, serve, obey, and remain loyal to those we’re in relationship with, we are doing those things for Jesus. When others do so for us, we are being loved by Jesus. 

Elsewhere, Paul describes the people of God’s Church as Jesus’ body (1 Corinthians 12:27). And until Jesus returns, the way a watching world will see and experience Jesus’ body sacrificed for them is when husbands, wives, parents, children, and workers love and honor one another.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who gives us freedom and life. And may you see Jesus as the one who uses our most significant relationships to demonstrate his love and power to the world."

A group of leaders are dividing the Colossian church by teaching that the apostle Paul’s Gospel is too simple. If the Colossians really want to experience the true fullness of God and true freedom from their immoral pasts, they need to borrow from the religious traditions around them. But over and over Paul says that everything they need to follow Jesus, experience God, and be free from immorality has already been given to them in Jesus (Colossians 2:6).

One faction claims that appealing to spiritual powers in addition to Jesus will grant a more well-rounded and fuller spiritual life. Paul says this risks entangling seekers to either more sinister or simplistic spiritual forces (Colossians 2:8). Besides, the fullness of God’s power and authority has already been given to the Colossians. Jesus lives inside them (Colossians 2:9-10). There is no need to appeal to other spiritual traditions to get a fuller experience of God. 

A Jewish faction claimed that you could prove to God you had “cut off” the evil parts of you by being circumcised. But Paul says Jesus has already accomplished a greater circumcision (Colossians 2:11). Their whole body was buried with Jesus through baptism, and every evil part of us was left in the grave when God raised us from the dead (Colossians 2:12). The evil parts of us aren’t cut off with a knife but by Jesus’ cross. We are already forgiven and don’t need to prove anything to God (Colossians 2:13-14).

Still others claimed that “good” Christians ate kosher and rested on the Sabbath (Colossians 2:16). The best Christians had a certain view of politics (Colossians 2:15). True Christians fasted and had visions (Colossians 2:18). But Paul says that while all these things might seem wise, they ultimately divide us and have no ability to free us from our immoral past or give us the fullness of God (Colossians 2:23). Besides, what they are looking for in politics, Sabbath regulations, and visions has already been given to them. Jesus’ resurrection disarmed political power (Colossians 2:15). The Sabbath is about Jesus (Colossians 2:17). Visions in our heads can’t change us, but the Head of the church can resurrect us in his image (Colossians 2:19).

Instead of looking down to human philosophies, powers, and traditions, God’s people should look up to the resurrected Jesus seated in the heavens and their new life in him (Colossians 3:2-3). Jesus alone makes his people full and free (Colossians 3:4). The Colossians’ life is in heaven with Jesus, which means they already have everything they need to kill the earthly things in them and put on their new identity as recreated humans (Colossians 3:5, 10). Instead of hearts full of jealousy and division, they can put on kindness and forgiveness (Colossians 3:5-9, 12-15). They only need Jesus to have a full spiritual life and be free from their immoral past. 

Where is the Gospel?

Paul ends this section of his letter by encouraging the Colossians to be unified (Colossians 3:15). Insisting that fullness of God and freedom from evil is provided in Jesus alone creates unity among people who would normally disagree (Colossians 3:16). In Jesus there isn’t a Jewish and non-Jewish way to please God. There isn't a circumcised or uncircumcised way to prove our fidelity. There is only Jesus (Colossians 3:11). In him we die, and in him we are all raised. 

Jesus' cross and resurrection has created a new global and international people of God who are united in their common hope that Jesus alone makes them full and free. The more we allow this truth to live in us and the more we insist on this truth to others, the more we can be unified in thankfulness to the God who saved us all (Colossians 3:16).

Now, there is nothing wrong with deciding to eat kosher or keeping the Sabbath. There’s nothing wrong with wanting your friends to experience a deeper fullness in their relationship with God through fasting or spiritual experiences. And there’s nothing wrong with aligning yourself to and defending certain political ideologies. What’s wrong is teaching, implying, or acting as if your convictions can provide more fullness and freedom than Jesus’ cross. This kind of superiority makes unity impossible. Instead, people who have been saved by God’s grace in Jesus should do everything in the name of the Lord who unites them (Colossians 3:17). And thank God it is Jesus’ power and not our convictions that save us. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has given us Jesus. And may you see Jesus as the only person we need to experience the fullness of God and the freedom from our evil.

The apostle Paul ends his letter to the Colossians with several personal messages that serve to emphasize three points he made earlier.

A few verses back Paul told slaves to willingly serve as if they are serving Jesus. And he told masters to remember they are slaves to their Master, God (Colossians 3:22-4:1). So, Paul introduces his coworker Tychicus and an escaped slave named Onesimus (Colossians 4:7-9). The Colossian church met in the home of Onesimus' master and were well aware that Onesimus had run away (Philemon 1-2). Nevertheless, Paul tells the church to welcome Onesimus back as a brother, even as Onesimus willingly returns as a slave (Colossians 4:9). In this introduction, Paul sets the Colossian church up to practice costly familial love in a relationship that would otherwise demand retribution.

Earlier, Paul went to great lengths to prove that there wasn’t a Jewish way and a Gentile way to please God. All people are united as God’s creations, and all people are saved by Jesus alone (Colossians 3:10). So, Paul lists the names of three Jews and three Greeks who are his coworkers and records their greetings (Colossians 4:10-11, 12-14). This list of six names reminds the Colossians that they are a part of Jesus’ plan to unite all people in his salvation (Colossians 3:11). 

Throughout his letter Paul stresses the Colossians’ need to mature in the teachings of Jesus. By going deeper into the message of Jesus, Paul knows the Colossians will experience the fullness of God and mirror the life of Jesus (Colossians 2:6-3:17). So, Paul highlights Epaphras, the founder of the Colossian church. Epaphras traveled to Paul in prison, both to encourage him and to ask advice about his church. During that time Paul saw Epaphras’ deep love for the Colossians and how he earnestly prayed that they would mature in their dedication to Jesus (Colossians 4:12-13). As an apostle, Paul shared this responsibility (Colossians 1:28-29). And mentioning Epaphras’ prayer for maturity is an effective way to both end his letter and remind the Colossians of their need to go deeper into the truth and life of Jesus. 

Where is the Gospel?

A mature follower of Jesus accepts that he is saved by Jesus alone and sacrificially loves even when it might be within his right to demand retribution. These are difficult lessons to live, but the book of Colossians ends with hope—the hope that it’s possible to mature as a follower of Jesus. 

We can hope to mature in godliness because of everything Paul has written before these personal messages. The fullness of God’s power lives in us (Colossians 2:9-10). The old, dead, and sinful parts of us have been nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:12-13). We are entirely forgiven of our past misdeeds. And the shame that should be associated with facing our sins has been disarmed because in Jesus our humiliations will become moments of resurrection (Colossians 2:15). 

In Jesus, you are maturing, day by day and step by step, into the image of Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:18). Be confident, you are maturing every time you remember what Jesus has done for you. You are not the same as you once were. Even if you feel like nothing has changed and that you are the same person you were three years ago, it’s not true. If you’re keeping your eyes on Jesus, he promises to mature you. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who transforms us. And may you see Jesus maturing you into his image every time you remember what he has done for you. "

He is the one who will empower us. And he is the one who will help us endure the unimaginable.",Website,1 & 2 Thessalonians Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The apostle Paul challenges the Thessalonians to grow in godliness and spiritual maturity in their relationships with sex, love, work, and death (1 Thessalonians 4:1-2). Paul begins by addressing their relationship with sex. The Thessalonians' culture valued immediate sexual gratification and turned a blind eye toward taking advantage of women, men of lower social status, and children (1 Thessalonians 4:3-6). But God created sex to be a demonstration and celebration of God’s generosity and creative power in marriage. So Paul warns that those who prize their sexual release over God's intentions are rebelling against their Creator (1 Thessalonians 4:7-8). Instead, all of their relationships should be marked by a growing similarity between their actions and their Creator’s intention. 

One area where the Thessalonians do not need to improve is their willingness to love others. They are well known throughout the region for their loving disposition to each other, so Paul tells them to keep doing what they are doing (1 Thessalonians 4:9).

Paul then tells the Thessalonians to be more mature in their working lives. Some in Thessalonica took advantage of more wealthy members of their church and relied too frequently on them to pay their bills. Paul tells them that all believers should have an ambition to work hard and be financially independent so that they can be generous to others and win the respect of outsiders to the church (1 Thessalonians 4:9-12).

Finally, Paul addresses the Thessalonians' relationship with death. Paul does not want them to grieve hopelessly when their friends die under persecution. He reminds them that Jesus died and rose again. Anyone who dies for Jesus will certainly be raised by Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4:13-15). And one day soon, Jesus will come again, and the faithful living and the faithful dead will together join Jesus in his victory parade. The dead are not gone forever, but waiting to join the living on the day Jesus establishes himself as King on earth forever (1 Thessalonians 4:16-18). While their persecutors might now gloat over their victories, they will fall (1 Thessalonians 5:1-3). The Thessalonians shouldn’t live in anxiety over the growing power of their enemies but in the hope that they will soon be defeated. Their vindication and salvation have been secured by Jesus when he rose from the dead (1 Thessalonians 5:4-9). And all of their loved ones who have died will soon rise, just like their Savior, and live with them and with God forever (1 Thessalonians 5:10-11).

Paul concludes with over a dozen encouragements and a prayer. But Paul doesn’t pray for the Thessalonians' grit or resolve to do all that he’s asked. Rather, he asks God to do the work. He asks God to mature the Thessalonians into people who are increasingly godly and can endure suffering in hope (1 Thessalonians 5:23-24). 

Where is the Gospel?

In Paul’s short letter, he instructs us on how to spiritually mature in four of our most common human experiences: sex, love, work, and death. Paul also gives us several motivations to pursue that maturity, ranging from obeying our Creator to the hope of the resurrection.

It is difficult to become more godly in a cultural or political climate that would persecute us. We can often wonder if we are strong enough to hold up under the pressure. We wonder if we would remain faithful if the stakes were higher. We wonder if we would have what it takes to die for our beliefs. But Paul ends his letter by reminding us that our faithfulness, spiritual maturity, and godliness are not dependent on our grit but on God’s faithfulness. He is the one who will make us holy. He is the one who will empower us. And he is the one who will help us endure the unimaginable (1 Thessalonians 5:23-24). Jesus will always be more faithful to us than we are to him. So instead of anxiously wondering if we have what it takes, we can always ask him to mature and strengthen us—and he will do it. 

See For Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who matures his people. And may you see Jesus as the one who has died and risen to mature and strengthen you. "

Paul wraps up his second letter to the Thessalonians by asking them to pray for him and his co-workers. He asks them to pray that the message of Jesus will continue to advance through their ministry and that they will be rescued from anyone who wishes them harm (2 Thessalonians 3:1-2). Paul then asks God to strengthen and protect the Thessalonians. He asks God to guide their hearts to love one another and endure any new challenges. And Paul is confident God will answer (2 Thessalonians 3:3).

Paul then addresses an issue he brought up in his first letter. Several members of the Thessalonian community were being generous to a fault and being taken advantage of by others who refused to work and meet their own needs (1 Thessalonians 5:12-13; 2 Thessalonians 3:6). Paul tells them to call out and cut off any who take advantage of another’s generosity. While he stayed with them, Paul worked a day job to provide for his own needs so that he wouldn’t be a burden to anyone. He did this to set an example, not just to the lazy, but to the generous as well. The lazy need to cultivate a better work ethic, but the generous need to learn when their giving actually prevents others from becoming the hard (and eventually generous) workers God intends them to be (2 Thessalonians 3:7-10). 

Paul ends his letter by signing his own name and praying that God’s grace and peace will be with them (2 Thessalonians 2:16-18). 

Where is the Gospel?

Followers of Jesus are supposed to be hard workers who are generous to others. This is the example Paul left to his disciples, and it’s also the example Jesus gave us (1 Thessalonians 1:6). Jesus spent his early adult years as a carpenter caring for his mother. And his ministry to the poor, sick, hungry, and demonized left Jesus drained and tired (John 4:5-6). And while we don’t normally call Jesus’ torture and crucifixion “work,” without his effort and endurance none of us would experience God’s eternal generosity. 

More than the healings Jesus performed, Jesus’ greatest work was doing everything needed on the cross so that we can become a part of God’s Kingdom and receive eternal life. Jesus’ hard work there brought God’s generosity to all people. Because of him, we stand to receive all the riches of God’s Kingdom (James 2:5). While we should work hard to bless others, we don’t need to work hard to earn God’s blessing and eternal life—his hard work has done it all for us! And if we have been saved by Jesus’ hard work, we have every reason to be generous and hard-working towards others (Ephesians 3:16-19).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who calls his people to live generously. And may you see Jesus as the one whose hard work has earned you a place in his eternal Kingdom. "

",Website,1 & 2 Timothy Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The apostle Paul is on trial in Rome, and he’s unsure he will survive (2 Timothy 4:6). This is Paul’s final letter and he addresses it to his protege Timothy, who he hopes will continue his ministry after his death (2 Timothy 1:14). 

But Timothy is discouraged. The same false teachers Paul addressed in his first letter are still successfully deceiving churches despite his best efforts to stop them (2 Timothy 2:17; 1 Timothy 1:20). But Paul encourages Timothy that their success is no reason to dismiss his own gift and leadership (2 Timothy 1:6). Not only has Timothy inherited a sincere and vibrant faith from his mother and grandmother, but Timothy is also filled with God’s Spirit (2 Timothy 1:5; 6). He doesn’t need to be timid because God has filled him with the power, love, and self-discipline needed for the task ahead (2 Timothy 1:7). 

While others are ashamed of Paul and his ministry (2 Timothy 1:15), Timothy should know that by associating with Paul in his suffering he’s also joining himself to Jesus and his power (2 Timothy 1:8). Jesus saved both Paul and Timothy by his death. And God called them both to ministry—not because they were braver than most, but because God decided that a murderous Pharisee and a timid Timothy would preach of the resurrection life offered in Jesus (2 Timothy 1:9-10). Timothy doesn’t need to be discouraged. His faith is real; he is filled by God’s Spirit, and God has chosen him. 

While others see Paul’s imprisonment and suffering as reasons to reject his message, Timothy should guard the truth that their Savior was bound, suffered, and died to give life to all (2 Timothy 1:14). Despite the claims of the false teachers, suffering is the way of Jesus and the path to resurrection. Followers of Jesus are like soldiers unashamed of the suffering of war in hope of a certain victory (2 Timothy 2:4-5). Or like athletes and farmers who are not ashamed to carry the weight of hard work and painful training to gain a harvest and prize (2 Timothy 2:5-6).

So while yes, Paul is bound in chains for the Gospel, God’s Word is not bound (2 Timothy 2:8-9). Jesus has risen from the 

dead

. And if suffering is the path to resurrection, Paul and Timothy should be willing to endure whatever it takes to see more of God’s children in eternity (2 Timothy 2:10).

Where is the Gospel?

Paul ends his opening paragraphs to Timothy with a hymn. It’s one of many songs composed by the first followers of Jesus. And it’s meant as additional encouragement to Timothy to not be ashamed and to not fear. The song says if we die with Jesus, we will live with God. And if we endure suffering we will reign alongside God (2 Timothy 2:11-12a). They’re solemn reminders of the inevitable suffering the Gospel brings, but they’re also impenetrable promises that not even death and chronic imprisonment can chain God, his Gospel, or his followers. There is no reason Timothy should be ashamed of the Gospel, even when it produces suffering. The Gospel reminds us that when we suffer, Jesus’ victory becomes ours. 

The song continues with encouragement to those of us who are unsure of how we would respond to Jesus’ call to suffer. It says that if we deny God, God will deny us; but if we are faithless, he remains faithful because God cannot deny himself (2 Timothy 2:12b-13). Once we choose to share Christ’s sufferings, we are inseparably joined to Jesus and his victory. There may be times when the burden of following Jesus will seem too great and the shame too deep. Timothy might have been on the edge of one of these moments himself. But God’s faithfulness is more powerful than our faithlessness. He does not deny those with whom he has shared his grave. 

So be encouraged along with Timothy. Timidity, shame, or the times you’ve avoided suffering, do not reverse your resurrection. God does not deny himself, and God will be faithful to bring you to eternal life. You will reign with him forever. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who does not deny himself. And may you see Jesus as the one who died so that we can join him in his life. "

Paul ends his letter to Timothy by telling him to run towards godliness and to fight the good fight of faith as he faces three different challenges in his church (1 Timothy 6:11-12). Regardless of the issue, Timothy should approach those in need of correction like family (1 Timothy 5:1). 

The first issue concerns caring for widows (1 Timothy 5:2). Some families had abandoned their elderly mothers and grandmothers after their husbands’ passing (1 Timothy 5:4). Paul says this is not only ungodly but is worse than denying faith in Jesus (1 Timothy 5:8). Families should care for their widows. At the same time, there were younger widows who took advantage of the church’s widow-care ministry and stole from more hard-pressed widows (1 Timothy 5:6). Rather than using their widowhood to serve others more freely (1 Timothy 5:10), they used it to gossip, cultivate division, and bring harm to the reputation of God’s Church (1 Timothy 5:13-15). And like the children who failed to care for their widowed relatives, these ungodly widows have abandoned their faith too (1 Timothy 5:15).

Secondly, Paul advises on how to deal with corrupt leaders. Some taught dangerous lies that stoked conspiracies and division (1 Timothy 6:4). Some even did so for profit (1 Timothy 6:5). But when Timothy confronts them, Paul warns against overreacting. The hurt some leaders cause shouldn’t devolve into prejudice against all church leaders (1 Timothy 5:19, 21). Calling a church leader to account has its place (1 Timothy 5:20). But the misuse of teaching authority in some doesn’t mean it's wrong for teachers to be paid or to exercise godly authority (1 Timothy 5:18). Rather, a church’s leaders need to be chosen slowly, with special attention given to a consistent pattern of godly behavior over time (1 Timothy 5:22, 24-25). 

Paul then pivots to a third issue with Christian slaves. Several Christian slaves rightly pointed out that their relationship with their Christian masters had radically changed. They are now brothers in Jesus (1 Timothy 6:2a). But some slaves used this truth as a justification to disrespect their brother-masters. This disrespect made it easy for Romans to dismiss the teachings of Jesus as incompatible with a Roman way of life (1 Timothy 6:1b). Paul never denies the master and slave’s equality but says that respect should govern their relationship (1 Timothy 6:1a, 2b). Just as the widows and church leaders, slaves must act in a way that’s obviously good and godly to those outside the church, even if the situation is less than what the Gospel demands. 

Paul then warns Timothy that some will teach against these things in order to get rich. There is always money to be made in division (1 Timothy 6:5). But Timothy should cultivate contentment to avoid falling into the ungodliness, profiteering, and controversies of his peers (1 Timothy 6:6-8).

Where is the Gospel?

Paul ends his letter to Timothy by telling him to run towards godliness and to fight the good fight of faith (1 Timothy 6:11-12). Timothy must continue to patiently endure through the problems in his church while he continues to confess the truth of eternal life in Jesus. 

This is what Jesus did (1 Timothy 6:13). In front of Pilate, a ruler who argued with Jesus about the nature of truth, Jesus held to his confession that he was the King of Truth who was born to bring his people into a Kingdom of eternal life (John 18:37). And right after this, Jesus rose from the dead. Timothy must not swerve from this truth (1 Timothy 6:14).

The truth Timothy possesses is the only teaching he needs. There are no corrupt leaders, divisive widows, or other truth that can ultimately harm the church God has entrusted to him. As Jesus said to Pilate, he is King of kings, Lord of lords, and he is coming soon to Timothy’s aid (1 Timothy 6:15-16). There are a lot of lies in the church. But when we confess what is true in a context of evil and division, there will be resurrection. God’s family will not fail. So just as Timothy and Jesus confess that Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords forever, guard your confession of this Gospel with your life. Guard your heart against division and the temptation to profit off of it. And fight for God’s family because Jesus is coming soon. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is Truth. And may you see Jesus as the one who confessed that he is the King of the world and through whom we have eternal life. "

Paul and his co-worker Silas began a church in Thessalonica. But after only three weeks they are kicked out of the city by a group of violent Jewish religious leaders. Quickly, these leaders began persecuting those convinced by Paul’s message that there is another king besides Caesar, namely Jesus (Acts 17:1-10; 1 Thessalonians 2:17-3:11). In response, Paul sends a letter. In it he spends most of the opening paragraphs thanking God for these new believers and all that God has done for them (1 Thessalonians 1:2-3). He remembers how they eagerly accepted his message about Jesus and joyfully followed Jesus’ example by enduring the significant persecution that followed (1 Thessalonians 1:4-6). News had even traveled throughout the Mediterranean regarding the Thessalonians' faithfulness to God and their rejection of Thessalonica’s idolatry. Paul tells them to keep suffering well as they wait for Jesus to rescue them from their persecutors (1 Thessalonians 1:7-10).

Part of the Thessalonians’ persecution was a smear campaign against Paul and Silas. Accused of being greedy street preachers who abandon their disciples when things get rough, Paul reminds the Thessalonians they have endured much suffering on their behalf. Before they arrived in Thessalonica they had been in a Phillippian prison for preaching about Jesus, and they continued to teach in Thessalonica despite the opposition and riots that followed them (1 Thessalonians 2:1-2). They made no use of tricks or manipulation to guarantee their comfort; rather, just as Jesus taught them to expect, their ministry has been one of suffering (1 Thessalonians 2:3-6). Far from greedy street preachers, they were like sacrificial mothers and fathers to them (1 Thessalonians 2:7-12). The Thessalonians have not been duped, but instead have discerned that the message they heard came straight from God. They joined Jesus' growing but suffering spiritual family (1 Thessalonians 2:13-15). And since they’re suffering just as Jesus suffered, they can be confident that God will empower and strengthen them until the day God deals with their enemies and vindicates his persecuted family (1 Thessalonians 2:16).

Where is the Gospel?

Only a few weeks after hearing the good news of Jesus' death and resurrection, the Thessalonians have become models of faith throughout the Mediterranean. It’s no wonder Paul spends most of the letter praying and praising God for their faithfulness.

But the Thessalonians aren’t super-Christians. They don’t have more grit or determination than most. Paul says the reason for their remarkable ability to endure suffering and live godly lives is because they received the good news of Jesus as a message straight from God (1 Thessalonians 2:13). When they accepted Jesus’ death and resurrection in their place, that good news became an active force in their lives. Their belief that Jesus suffered for them empowered them to suffer for Jesus. Elsewhere, Paul talks about God’s Word being “living and active” and how looking to Jesus transforms those who believe his message (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Corinthians 3:18). The Thessalonians are living proof that Jesus empowers his people to endure persecution and mature in their faith.

Our temptations and persecutions have not lessened since the days of Paul, but neither has the transformative power of the good news of God’s Word. If you are struggling to remain faithful and straining to live a godly life, yet seeing little success, both Paul and the Thessalonians would tell you, “Look to the risen Jesus.”In Jesus' death and resurrection, there is power and hope. Instead of meditating on your failures, meditate on what Jesus has done and watch as God himself empowers and transforms you through his Word—and Jesus’ power.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who transforms his people through suffering. And may you see Jesus clearly so that you will be transformed into people who suffer well and will one day live forever."

The apostle Paul calls the Church God's house (1 Timothy 3:15). And like most homes under Roman rule, houses under God’s rule include both men and women, as well as leaders and slaves. But a group of divisive teachers disputed the order inside God’s Church, and so threatened the unity of God’s home (1 Timothy 1:3).

Many had begun to resent their Roman governors (1 Timothy 2:1-2a). But Paul says that for God’s house to grow in peace, followers of Jesus must pray for those who rule over them  (1 Timothy 2:2b-4). Jesus died for all people (1 Timothy 2:5). And his blood makes it possible for Jews and Gentiles, rich and poor, slaves and governors to enter God’s house (1 Timothy 2:6). God’s family should dedicate themselves to peace and unity, not insurrection or division. 

So, rather than men raising their fists in resentment at their political or social situation, they are told to lift up their hands in prayer (1 Timothy 2:8). And women, rather than putting on expensive clothes and alienating the poor, should instead clothe themselves in godliness and good works (1 Timothy 2:9-10). 

Paul also warns that a certain group of women in Timothy’s church are on the verge of repeating what happened in the Garden of Eden. Just as Eve was influenced by the false teacher Satan, these women have been influenced by new false teachers (1 Timothy 2:14). And like Eve taught Adam to eat the fruit, these women teach others to abandon the rules of God’s house. Paul says women must not do this. Just as God made Adam first, God has made Timothy a teacher in their church (1 Timothy 2:13). These women are dividing God’s house, subverting Timothy and the other male leaders’ authority (1 Timothy 2:12). Instead, these women should humbly learn what God says in Scripture 

from

 their leaders (1 Timothy 2:11). Rather than resent this, these women should remember that women are part of the salvation story too. And through motherhood and the birth of the child Jesus, all people—both men and women—are saved (1 Timothy 2:15).

Paul transitions into qualifications for two kinds of leaders in God’s house: overseers and deacons. How they lead and serve their own homes is what qualifies them to lead and serve God’s house (1 Timothy 3:4-5,12). Unlike the divisive teachers, these leaders must not teach what is false. With a clear conscience, they must know and teach the truth (1 Timothy 3:2, 9). These leaders are to be above reproach, worthy of respect (1 Timothy 3:2, 8, 11), and well thought of by outsiders (1 Timothy 3:7, 10).

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus has united men and women, Gentiles and Jews, rulers and slaves into a new type of home. And the way the members of God’s house treat each other is how the world will know Jesus (1 Timothy 3:16). Men who put away resentment and put on prayer will cause governments to make peace. Women who put away power grabs and put on good works will create a family where the poor are not neglected. Godly leaders who teach the truth will have the ear of not just their neighbors but the nations. Jesus' resurrection empowers the members of God’s house to save the world. And there is ultimately no force of evil, division, or political power that can overthrow a church governed by men and women of character who pray, humbly learn, and do good because they have been filled by Jesus’ resurrection power. 

In his death, Jesus redefines power as humble service. And it’s good news that neither overthrowing imperial power nor usurping the leaders of God’s home is the way of Jesus. The way of Jesus means the powerless, the prayerful, and the humble win. Jesus prayed for the Romans who crucified him (Luke 23:34). Jesus became a slave, and now rules the universe (Philippians 2:8-9). God undid death through Jesus’ humility and prayer. And God’s Church will never fall when humble men and women of character do the same. So like Paul encourages Timothy’s church, let's pray. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has established one united Church through his Son. And may you see Jesus as the one who empowers and encourages us to seek unity and teach the truth.

The apostle Paul writes to his protege Timothy. But Timothy’s church is threatened by a group of misinformed and combative teachers (1 Timothy 1:3).

These teachers claim they’re experts in the Hebrew Law (1 Timothy 1:7). They go into great detail and argue about secrets hidden in the Law’s genealogies (1 Timothy 1:4), presumably to focus on the parts of the Bible that made them feel less guilty. But the Law was written 

for

 guilty, lawbreaking, rebellious people (1 Timothy 1:8-10). And the Law pointed towards the good news that guilt could be taken away when entrusted to another (1 Timothy 1:9-11). Jesus didn’t die for good people but for sinners. The goal of Timothy’s ministry is to patiently help these so-called experts to truly love and live out God’s commands because they can entrust their guilt to Jesus (1 Timothy 1:5-7). 

Paul reminds Timothy that he used to be just like these false teachers. Paul too misunderstood God’s laws, was a combative blasphemer, and even murdered those who disagreed with him (1 Timothy 1:13). But God showed Paul mercy because Jesus didn’t come to save good people (1 Timothy 1:14). Jesus came to save sinners, and Paul was a worse sinner than the ones Timothy is confronting (1 Timothy 1:15). 

Paul says he is a living example of the good news that God is 

patient

 with the misinformed, divisive, and violent (1 Timothy 1:16). While the false teachers Timothy is dealing with are dangerous and should be avoided, Paul also knows patience means even the worst sinner can learn to love and follow Jesus again (1 Timothy 1:20). So, like God, Timothy must be patient. He must hold on to his faith in Jesus, endure in his love for God’s laws, and consistently preach that Jesus can and does save sinners (1 Timothy 1:19).

Where is the Gospel?

The false teachers preferred to focus on the parts of the Bible that made them feel less guilty. They enjoyed debates over details in genealogies. They liked arguing ancient myths. And like Paul they used their Bibles to justify their violence and combativeness, rather than let their Bibles challenge their behavior. Ironically, by avoiding their guilt they missed the good news. God is incredibly patient towards even the worst people. 

When God gives himself a name in Scripture, he says he is in his being compassionate, gracious, slow to anger. and abounding in steadfast love (Exodus 34:6). There is no need to hide our guilt before this kind of patient God—especially when God patiently endured thousands of years of human rebellion, only to send himself to die rather than judge his people too soon (John 12:47). We don’t have to hide our sin. We don’t have to avoid our guilt. We can entrust our guilt to Jesus. He is patient towards all who come to him. And he cancels the condemnation, guilt, and shame that we fear (Romans 8:1). 

You don’t need to pretend you're good. Good people don’t need Jesus. And the good news is that Jesus is endlessly patient toward even the most wayward. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is endlessly patient. And may you see Jesus as the one we can trust to restore even the worst sinners. "

Philemon is the only letter of the apostle Paul that doesn’t mention Jesus’ death or resurrection. That’s because following Jesus transforms our relationships with each other. Writing from prison, Paul expects a slave master named Philemon to become Jesus to his slave, Onesimus. 

Philemon is one of Paul’s partners. They are not only joined together in Jesus, but partners in a common mission (Philemon 1-2). One of Paul’s disciples began a house church in Colossae, and Philemon is its host and one of its leaders (Philemon 23, Colossians 1:7). And like most wealthy men of his day, Philemon owned slaves—one of whom was named Onesimus. Onesimus had run away from Philemon to Paul, presumably for help. But after meeting Paul, Onesimus becomes a follower of Jesus and quickly another valued partner of Paul (Philemon 10, 13). Paul even calls Onesimus his “very heart” (Philemon 12).

After praising Philemon for his love of God and neighbor, Paul prays that Philemon’s partnership with him will deepen by doing him a favor (Philemon 6, 20). If they’re partners, Paul says he wants Philemon to welcome Onesimus back as if he were Paul himself (Philemon 17). And if Onesimus has wronged Philemon, Paul promises to bear the cost (Philemon 18).

This is a delicate way to make a radical request. Up to one-third of ancient Rome would have been slaves. Wealthy men like Philemon provided loans, and men like Onesimus paid it off by working on their estate. To welcome Onesimus back as a partner is radically at odds with welcoming him back as a slave with a debt—not to mention radically at odds with the economic and social fabric of the Roman Empire.

More important than their legal and social relationship is Paul’s role as a spiritual father to both Philemon and Onesimus. They are brothers first (Philemon 16). Paul, Philemon, and Onesimus are now joined together in Jesus. And all three are now partners in the same mission in Colossae.

 

These new categories of brother and partner are more significant than the old categories of slave and master (Philemon 16). Paul then ends his letter confident that Philemon will refresh his “heart” (which is how Paul referred to Onesimus earlier) and do even more than what he has asked (Philemon 20-21).

Where is the Gospel?

Philemon is the only letter written by the apostle Paul that doesn’t mention Jesus’ death or resurrection. In part that’s because Paul is transformed by Jesus’ cross; he is being Jesus to Onesimus. Just as Jesus took the form of a slave to free him, Paul joins Onesimus in his slavery and identifies him as his very heart (Philippians 2:7). Just as Jesus charges Paul’s debts to his account, Paul offers to pay off any debt Onesimus incurred (Galatians 3:13-14). Paul is Onesimus’ mediator, as Jesus has been his. Paul also calls for Philemon to be like Jesus in this letter. Just as Jesus called Paul to partner with him to reconcile the world, Paul calls Onesimus to reconcile with Philemon, who is now first a brother and partner (2 Corinthians 5:18). 

As Paul says elsewhere, in Jesus there is no slave or free but one new humanity (Galatians 3:28). Before God and his cross, social or economic categories are redefined by our new calling as partners with God. In Jesus, we are compelled to treat others with kindness and sacrificial love beyond what our society, legal rights, or personal debt might demand. If we are partners with Jesus, then we will be willing to lose status in our society, lose our rights, and even absorb the debts we’re owed. Jesus would tell us to charge others’ debts to his account and trust he will make good. Philemon’s relationship with Onesimus was redefined because of Jesus. Our relationships with one another and our society must be transformed by Jesus too.  

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see that God has joined us to each other in Jesus. And may you see Jesus as our partner in reconciliation to those around us."

Out of death and suffering, God always brings life and joy.",Website,Philippians Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

In prison for preaching the good news that Jesus’ death leads to eternal life, the apostle Paul pens a letter to his friends in Philippi (Philippians 1:7). He reminds them that his imprisonment is being used by God. His suffering has caused others to trust Jesus as their King and Savior (Philippians 1:12). He might be in chains, but the Gospel cannot be bound. Prison guards are hearing the good news of Jesus (Philippians 1:13). Christians, seeing the example of Paul under arrest, are boldly and fearlessly sharing the Gospel (Philippians 1:14). Though Paul is in chains and he may soon face death, he rejoices that Jesus is proclaimed (Philippians 1:18).

Prisoners in the first century were not typically provided basic necessities. They had to rely on family and friends to support them. The Philippian church, moved with compassion for their friend, sent a financial gift to provide for Paul in his need (Philippians 4:18). Paul now writes back this letter to send his heartfelt thanks. Yet he has also heard of the divisions spreading in the church he founded (Philippians 1:27, 4:2-3). He puts pen to paper, thinking of the one thing that has sustained him all these years: joy in Jesus.

Paul will soon stand trial, and he waits for that day, not with anxiety but with joy. He is convinced that Jesus will be praised by either his release or his execution (Philippians 1:20). If he is spared, he will continue to share the Gospel. If he is killed, he gets to be with Jesus (Philippians 1:21-22). Regardless of his verdict, he encourages the Philippians to stand together, united by the Gospel he has given his life to proclaim (Philippians 1:27).

Where Is the Gospel?

Paul was no stranger to imprisonment. In fact, the first time he was arrested was in Philippi several years earlier (Acts 16:23-24). When one of his jailers trusted Jesus, Paul saw firsthand how God could use a prison cell (Acts 16:25-34). And now, once again in a Roman prison, Paul looks beyond his present suffering to the ways God is working to bring people to himself. He reminds us that even as things around us seem bleak, God uses those circumstances for good (Philippians 1:12-14). Out of death and suffering, God brings life and joy (Philippians 1:18).

The good news of Jesus transformed the way Paul saw everything. Jesus shows us that our suffering leads to resurrection. Like Paul, Jesus was arrested, tried, and even executed. He willingly laid down his own life for us, becoming enchained in the prison of death. But this wasn’t the end. His imprisonment and death led to freedom and resurrection. The chains of death are forever broken, bringing us life with God. On the other side of his suffering, Jesus saw the joy that was to come. And this joy enabled him to endure the cross (Hebrews 12:2). Because Jesus suffered, we can now say, like Paul, “to live is Christ and to die is gain” (Philippians 1:21-23). Whether we live or die, Jesus will be seen as supreme. And in that, we can wholeheartedly rejoice.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who fills us with joy in the midst of suffering. And may you see Jesus as the one who offers us life with him, even beyond our death."

According to Paul, a life worthy of the Gospel that unites both Jews and Gentiles is a life marked by love (Ephesians 5:2), light (Ephesians 5:8), and wisdom (Ephesians 5:15). These are three nonnegotiable identifiers of God’s new family and people.

The love this new, united community demonstrates is not sexual, perverse, or greedy—and it’s grateful instead of vulgar (Ephesians 5:3-4). Obscenity, greed, and sensuality all prove citizenship of a kingdom not of God (Ephesians 5:5). God has rescued his people from that kingdom of darkness, and to return to it would be disastrous (Ephesians 5:6-7). Instead, God’s people are to reject darkness and live as children of the light (Ephesians 5:8). Light is good, just, true, and actively exposes the bad, unjust, and false (Ephesians 5:10-11). This exposure isn’t to shame those living in darkness (after all, they used to be just like them), but it’s to transform them. Light by its very nature dispels darkness, and by the light of Jesus in the lives of believers, darkness can be pushed back forever (Ephesians 5:12-13). Finally, living in love and light in a world of sex, greed, and darkness requires wisdom (Ephesians 5:15-16). But this wisdom isn’t first sobriety and self-denial; wisdom is first being filled with God’s Spirit and understanding what God desires (Ephesians 5:18).

Ultimately, love, light, and wisdom will lead us to humbly submit to one another in the power of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:21). Submission to the needs of one another is what Jesus did for us on the cross (Ephesians 5:25-26). By Jesus’ love, we are made holy (Ephesians 5:27). By Jesus' light, our sin is cast out. By Jesus’ wisdom, mysteries are revealed (Ephesians 5:31-32). Jesus’ humble submission to the needs of his people is what saved us.

So, Paul tells us that our most fundamental relationships with parents, spouses, and employers should reflect Jesus’ own humility and wise submission. Paul commands wives to submit, but also husbands to submit their very lives out of love for their bride (Ephesians 5:22, 25). Children should obey and honor their parents, and parents should not exasperate or anger their children (Ephesians 6:1, 4). Slaves should obey their masters as if they are obeying Jesus, and masters must remember they are also slaves because God is their Master (Ephesians 6:5, 9). All our relationships must be marked by the type of humility and love Jesus showed us (Ephesians 5:21).

Where is the Gospel?

Significantly, in Paul’s time, it would have been unheard of to address a child, wife, or slave before first acknowledging the parent, husband, or master. But in each relationship, Paul flips the script, honoring first the humble and weak and, only then, the powerful (Ephesians 5:22; 6:1, 5). Paul demonstrates in his letter’s structure the humility he expects his people to live out.

But Paul also knows that we will be tempted by our old ways. It will be easy for us to fall back into unwise living, unloving relationships, and prideful anger (Ephesians 5:6). Paul knows that we will be tempted by envy, sexual impurity, and lewdness. Paul knows humble submission is hard, especially when it leads to suffering. And on our own, it’s almost certain we will turn back to our older and easier ways.

But this is why Paul only gives us commands in the context of what Jesus has done. We can walk in love because Christ loved us and gave himself up for us first (Ephesians 5:2). We can live as children of the light because while we were once darkness, now we are light in the Lord (Ephesians 5:8). Paul knows what he commands is only possible when we see Jesus doing for us what we struggle to do for others.

Often, when we read commands like these, we feel guilty for not living up to them. So we promise that tomorrow we will try harder and be better. But tomorrow comes—and the moral progress we hope for is short-lived. We beat ourselves up again and try harder the next day. But Paul has no interest in motivating you with guilt and shame. Paul instead motivates us with the grace, forgiveness, and sacrifice Jesus has given us while we were still sinners.

None of us are as wise, loving, or humble as we should be, but thank God we have a Savior who is for us! So if you’re in a difficult marriage, job, or family, or if you find yourself pulled to your old ways of life, cast your eyes on Jesus and his love, wisdom, and humility! He has not only saved you but he will also perfect you into the loving and humble person he has called you to be (Hebrews 12:1).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who calls you to live a life of light, love, and wisdom. And may you see Jesus as the one who wisely, lovingly, and in wisdom saved you so that you can walk in obedience to God."

Because he loved us even to the point of death, complete joy is offered to us, because in Jesus, we have peace with God and one another.",Website,Philippians Bible Study,"What’s Happening

More than any other letter that Paul wrote, Philippians focuses on the joy we can find in Jesus. Thirteen times in this short letter, Paul mentions either joy or rejoicing. He doesn’t tire of repeating himself on this point. He even tells us, “It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you” (Philippians 3:1). This is all the more surprising since Paul finds himself in prison, awaiting possible execution. But despite Paul’s joy in Jesus, the Philippians are still tempted to turn their eyes away from Jesus. As he closes his letter, he warns them if they become centered around their anxieties and in-fighting, they will fail to point each other to the deeper joy found in God (Philippians 4:4).

Paul pleads with them to put away divisions and in-fighting, and instead be united with one mind and spirit around the good news of Jesus (Philippians 4:2-3). Rather than being driven by their anxieties to gossip, slander, and manipulate, Paul encourages them to bring every situation to God in prayer (Philippians 4:6). He tells them to set their minds on what is true and good and wholesome (Philippians 4:8). In this way, they will receive a peace from God which will keep their eyes off of their unresolved conflicts and focused on Jesus (Philippians 4:7). Paul has learned how to be content in every circumstance, whether good or bad. Even from a Roman prison, his joy doesn’t waver because his joy is in Jesus who gives him his strength (Philippians 4:11-13). If the Philippians follow his example, their divisions should take care of themselves.

Paul finishes his letter by expressing the joy he felt from their financial gift. For years, the Philippians sent aid to Paul in his trouble and need (Philippians 4:15-16). And in his darkest hour in a Roman prison while possibly awaiting execution, they go out of their way to support him. He would have been content in God even if his need had not been met. But through their gift, he rejoices even more (Philippians 4:10). Their gift becomes much more than a support check. It is an offering of thanksgiving to God (Philippians 4:18).

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus came to form a new type of people. In his death and resurrection, he created a people marked by his love and joy. Jesus didn’t just come to fix our relationship with God. Jesus also came to fix our relationships with one another. Instead of in-fighting and anxiety, his people can be marked by unity. Resolving conflicts, putting away past injustices, and choosing to love one another is the defining feature of people and communities who set their minds on Jesus. Jesus tells his disciples they will be known by their love towards one another, because they will love each other as he loved them (John 13:34-35).

Of course, loving others will be difficult. Paul’s love for his church meant he found himself in dark places, where he “despaired of life itself” (2 Corinthians 1:8). Jesus also knew the steep cost of love. He was a man of suffering, familiar with pain and sorrow (Isaiah 53:3). And Jesus died in his great love for the world (John 3:16). But both Paul and Jesus had a deep, lasting joy that sustained them throughout their life. Jesus found joy in his relationship with his Father as Paul found joy in his relationship to Jesus. Both Jesus and Paul’s relationship with God demanded sacrificial love but in loving, even to death, there was ultimate joy.

Jesus told his disciple that they should obey God’s commands to love so that his joy would live inside them, and that their joy might be completed and perfected (John 15:11). And Paul is proof that it’s possible to experience that joy, even from a prison cell. When we turn away from our conflicts and love even when it hurts, we aren’t dying pointlessly. We die in hope of eternal joy and resurrection life that nothing in this world can take away.

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who gives us joy in our darkest hour. And may you see Jesus as the one who is himself our joy

The apostle Paul wrote Ephesians from prison (Ephesians 3:1). His letter updates the church in Ephesus on how he is faring in prison and encourages them in their faith (Ephesians 6:22). Ephesus is a special place for Paul. He lived with and served among the Ephesians longer than any other church he planted (Acts 19:10). And it was the Ephesian elders Paul called to mourn and pray for him when he found out he was going to prison (Acts 20:17-38). But Paul knows Ephesus is also a divided church. Jews and new converts from across the Roman empire, called Gentiles, are at odds. So Paul writes from prison to encourage all Ephesisans in their common salvation and common Savior.

Paul begins with both a poem and a prayer. In a flood of poetic language he reminds the Ephesians of the promises God made throughout Scripture, and reveals how they all come true in Jesus (Ephesians 1:3). God promised to choose a people for himself (Deuteronomy 7:6). God also promised to make these chosen people a holy people (Exodus 19:6). And Paul says that in Jesus God has chosen us even before the foundations of the world (Ephesians 1:4). By Jesus’ blood and God’s grace we have all been redeemed for a life of godliness (Ephesians 1:7-8).

In all, Paul uses some iteration of the phrase “in Christ” 12 times in chapter one. In Christ, the fullness of God’s plan for forgiveness, redemption, and blessing is given to God’s people (Ephesians 1:7). In Christ, all things in heaven and on earth have been united (Ephesians 1:10). In Christ, we receive every spiritual blessing (Ephesians 1:3). In Christ, we’ve been sealed by the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13). None of these promises are new, but in the Old Testament they had been reserved for the Jewish family of Abraham (Genesis 12:2). But in Christ, what was once limited is now available to all people regardless of their ethnicity or family of origin (Ephesians 1:13). Originally the family of Israel was divided into 12 tribes. But now, in Christ, Paul reminds his people 12 times that they are part of a new family, tribe, and nation.

Almost as if overwhelmed by this good news, Paul asks God to give the Ephesians the capacity and wisdom needed to understand what’s happened through Jesus (Ephesians 1:17). The extension of God’s promises from the Jews to all others, in Christ, requires new eyes to see (Ephesians 1:18). But by God’s power, Paul hopes that the Ephesians will know they’re called to be a united family of God grounded in the resurrection of Jesus (Ephesians 1:19-20).

Where is the Gospel?

From the creation of the world, God has chosen to work through families. Salvation was promised through the family of Eve (Genesis 3:15). Blessing was promised through the family of Abraham (Genesis 12:3). Kingship was promised through the family of David (2 Samuel 7:12-16). God has always worked through the bloodlines of families, but in the Old Testament that bloodline was Jewish.

And in Christ, the family of Eve, the family of Abraham, and the family of David, all meet a promised Son, Jesus, who will save, bless, and rule the world. But Jesus does more than fulfill and complete the hopes of the Jewish people; he saves all people. Jesus creates a new family—not of a particular bloodline but from all nations. This is why Jesus’ genealogies are careful to point out the Gentiles in his family tree (Matthew 1:5).

In Christ, both Jews and Gentiles are included in God’s family, God’s blessing, and God’s Kingdom (Ephesians 1:12-13). All the blessings God’s people hoped for in the Old Testament are poured out in Christ. And now, through faith, the Gentiles who once were not a part of God’s family have been adopted as sons and daughters of God (Ephesians 1:5). There are many reasons why we might feel left out of God’s family and God’s plans. But Jesus makes it so that neither our bloodline nor family origin can prevent us from knowing the depths of the love of God in him.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has sent us his Son. And may you see Jesus as the one who has created a way for all people to be part of his family."

Paul ends his letter by reminding the Ephesian church that their life is a battle, not against each other, but against spiritual powers (Ephesians 6:12). Paul draws his readers’ attention to dark spiritual powers several times. In chapter one we’re told God raised Jesus from the dead and onto a throne above all spiritual authorities (Ephesians 1:19b-21a). He adds that God has placed all demonic powers under Jesus’ feet for the benefit and protection of his church (Ephesians 1:22-23). In chapter two Paul says that we were once ruled by the “Ruler of the Air”, and were once spiritual sons and daughters of disobedience (Ephesians 2:2). In chapter three he says that when Jews and Gentiles put aside their division and are joined together in one church, it preaches the wisdom of God to spiritual powers (Ephesians 3:10). And in chapter four even misplaced anger has demonic consequences (Ephesians 4:26-27). Our battle is primarily spiritual.

And since this battle is a spiritual one, our preparation must be a spiritual one as well. Paul tells us to prepare for battle with what he calls the armor of God (Ephesians 6:11). But this armor is strange. It’s less about our preparedness to fight, but our reception of the gifts and grace of God. Each piece of God’s armor is a blessing that can only come from God: truth and righteousness (Ephesians 6:14), peace (Ephesians 6:15), faith (Ephesians 6:16), salvation, and his Holy Spirit (Ephesians 6:17). Believers arm themselves against the spiritual powers by remembering what God has done for them. The way believers extinguish the lies and attacks of an enemy is to remember, to put on, and to arm ourselves with what God has done for us in Christ.

Paul’s final encouragement is simple: pray (Ephesians 6:18). Through prayer, the powers of darkness are once again shamed by the light of God’s salvation (Colossians 2:15). Through prayer, darkness is pushed back. And more personally, Paul hopes the Ephesians will pray for boldness as he declares the defeat of the powers and the mystery of the Gospel to the powers that have imprisoned him (Ephesians 6:19-20).

Where is the Gospel?

Our battle is primarily spiritual, and it’s primarily fought by God. Jesus has already defeated the powers and we freely walk in his victory. Even the armor we’re supposed to put on was first worn by God. In the book of Isaiah, the prophet tells us that a coming Savior will fight on behalf of his people clothed with the very same armor Paul describes (Isaiah 59:16-17). The Savior that Isaiah prophesied is Jesus! Jesus puts on the armor as he fights for our salvation on the cross. He skewers our sin with his sword, and his faithfulness will never allow death to overthrow us again. In his resurrection, Jesus becomes our armor. In Jesus, the battle is already won and the weapons that have already defeated our enemy are ours to wear. Our call is to put on Jesus, who is our armor, and walk in his victory.

And let’s not forget that God, in his mercy, has seated us with Christ in the heavenly places (Ephesians 2:5). We have authority and power over the darkness that’s left creeping on the earth. Yes, our life is a battle, but we’re on the winning side. Our enemy has been crushed. His weapons are flaming, but feeble, for those in Jesus. So remember that your battle is a spiritual one. Your greatest enemy isn’t your boss, your spouse, or your prison guard. The powers of darkness want to use your situation to see you fall, but remember that Jesus has fought for you and won. Jesus now covers you in his own armor, and by his Spirit you will withstand these evil days.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who fights for us. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives us every spiritual blessing so that we can walk in his victory."

The church at Ephesus is filled with both Jews and Gentiles, natives of pagan cultures who now follow Jesus. The cultural differences between these two groups are profound. But more significantly, Jews believe only their laws and their temple give them access to God. So Paul implores his church to remember their unity in Jesus. 

Yes, Gentiles are sinners and dead in their transgressions, but so are Jews (Ephesians 2:1). Everyone, Jews included, have disqualified themselves from access to God by their disobedience (Ephesians 2:2). But God, in his great mercy, has made us alive by his grace (Ephesians 2:4-5). The Jews can’t boast about their historic connection to God, any more than the Gentiles can boast about their good deeds (Ephesians 2:8-9). They are all one—one in death, but also one in Christ and one in resurrection (Ephesians 2:11-22). 

For Paul, the Gospel levels the ground between all mankind. Jews had built literal walls in their temple and made laws to keep the Gentiles out (Ephesians 2:15a). But Jesus is a new temple, and has knocked the old walls down (Ephesians 2:14). By his body we have access to God and by his cross he has made us one (Ephesians 2:16). We can all, regardless of bloodline, be citizens of his Kingdom through faith (Ephesians 2:19). And better yet, Jesus has made us temples, and the Spirit who once rested behind a wall now lives in us (Ephesians 2:22)! 

Paul says this plan for Jews and Gentiles to be God’s united temple and Kingdom has been a mystery hidden since the Old Testament (Ephesians 3:6). And unpacking this mystery and preaching it to Gentiles who had once been excluded, is now his life’s mission regardless of the cost (Ephesians 3:8-9). Paul says his imprisonment and suffering are worth it, if God’s Church is united in the process (Ephesians 3:13).

Paul then interrupts his letter with another prayer to the common Father of every family on earth. He prays that the Spirit will strengthen the Ephesians' faith in Jesus (Ephesians 3:16). And that the Spirit will open their eyes to see the intense, expansive, and unknowably deep love of God for all people (Ephesians 3:18-19).

Where is the Gospel?

In the Old Testament, the presence of God’s Spirit is what set apart God’s people from the Gentiles. The temple in Jerusalem and the ark of the covenant were both symbols of God’s abiding presence and Israel’s privileged place among the nations (Numbers 10:33-36). In some ways, nothing’s changed. God’s Spirit still sets apart God’s people today. Only now, God doesn’t live in a temple made by man, but is within His own creation (1 Corinthians 3:16). God lives in you and me! 

This is good news because God’s people and presence are no longer bound by a location or nation. God’s new family is no longer marked by a physical or ethnic border, but is marked by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). Wherever we go we can proclaim the deep mystery that God is our common Father and has saved all people through his Son! 

In a world filled with divisions in class, race, and gender, Paul points us to God’s mysterious plan for unity (Ephesians 3:6). While the world wants to divide its people, the Spirit in Christ unifies all people. In Christ, there is only one nation, without borders, consisting of people from all tribes, tongues, and languages (Revelation 7:9). All people, whether slave or free, male or female, Jew or Gentile, are unified into one household, under one Father of all (Ephesians 3:15). 

And by God’s Spirit the power to unite a divided world now lives in 

us. As Paul says elsewhere, we are now ministers of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18). We are Spirit-empowered agents of unity in a world divided. In Christ, God has brought salvation to all, and now we’re filled with that same reconciling power, partnering with God to see the world united under him. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who offers salvation to all people. And may you see Jesus as the one who has died to break down our divisions and unite us to him."

In the first half of his letter, Paul holds a magnifying glass to the mystery of God’s inclusion of both Jews and Gentiles in Jesus. In chapter four, Paul zooms in on what that blood-bought mystery requires of us. Paul says we need to live a life worthy of this call (Ephesians 4:1) If we have put on freedom from division and sin, we need to take off the old ways that cause division and sin (Ephesians 4:22). We are to remove our old self, with its bitterness, rage, anger, brawling, slander, and malice (Ephesians 4:31). In its place, we are to put on that which reflects a new identity made righteous and holy by God and no longer marked by division (Ephesians 4:24-25). And this call to take off the old and put on the new is not only an individual one, but a corporate call as well. 

Corporately, we are to put on adoption into a new family—the Church (Ephesians 4:25). And Paul says this new family is to be marked by its oneness. The Church has one hope, which is found in one body and one Spirit, united under one Lord, one faith, and one baptism (Ephesians 4:4-6). Living worthy of this call means treating one another like we are united members of one body (Ephesians 4:25). We must also leverage the gifts God has given us individually to strengthen and mature each other corporately, as the body of Christ (Ephesians 4:11-12). 

Only the immature deny the necessity of unity and sacrificial service (Ephesians 4:14). If we want to grow up and mature as a body of Jesus-followers, we must become more and more like Jesus, who gave up his body to unite us (Ephesians 4:15). We must put off selfish indulgence, impurity, and greed, just as he did (Ephesians 4:19). We must take off our old self and put on a new self created to be like God in goodness and righteousness (Ephesians 4:24). We can’t lie anymore. We can’t steal anymore (Ephesians 4:25). We can’t tear each other down with our words, but must leverage every word to build up the body that Jesus died for (Ephesians 4:29). We have been recreated both individually and corporately into a new body, the Church. And now we must, like a body, mature into that calling. 

Where is the Gospel?

At creation, mankind was made to live with God and choose the things of God—that which is righteous and holy (Genesis 2:15-16). Yet, sadly, our first parents chose to turn from the things of God and thus clothe humanity in sin (Genesis 3:6). Everything Paul tells us to take off, was passed down from and put on us by Adam and Eve.

As offspring of Adam, we are born with a nature that is prone to sin, unable to choose the things of God (Romans 6:20). We need to be made new, to be given a new nature, and to be recreated. It is only through being made new that we can once again have the power to choose the things of God, such as kindness, compassion, and forgiveness (Ephesians 4:32). 

And the good news is that because Jesus willingly laid down his life for us, we can now lay down our old life too. The life marked by sin has been nailed to the cross, and Jesus’ righteous life has been given to us in exchange (2 Corinthians 5:21). We are now new creations. We have a new nature individually and a new body corportely. Because of Jesus, we can put off our old self and once again live a life that chooses the things of God. Because of Jesus you have a new nature, freed from sin and empowered to live a life worthy of the unity and salvation bought for you by our Savior.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who has made you a new creation. And may you see Jesus as the one who has exchanged his life for yours, that you might be free from sin and walk worthy of his call."

His way of humility leads to his exaltation and our joy.",Website,Philippians Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The apostle Paul wants the Philippian church to experience the joy in Jesus that he has. But division in the church is threatening that joy. Conflicts have bred division and chaos in Philippi. Many consider themselves more important than others and look out for their own interests first and foremost. Infighting, gossip, and slander are now common (Philippians 2:3-4, 14). Paul warns, if these conflicts continue, they will trade Jesus for strife, bitterness, and angst.

To combat this division, Paul encourages them to be united in their pursuit of becoming like Jesus (Philippians 2:1). He calls them to be so focused on Jesus that they have one mind, one heart, and one devotion for him (Philippians 2:2). Jesus is their perfect example of how to relate to one another (Philippians 2:5). Paul reminds them that Jesus is equal with God himself (Philippians 2:6). And then in humility, he leaves behind his power and refuses to make use of his equality with God and becomes human (Philippians 2:7). Jesus does not divide himself from others, nor does he use his power to seek his own interests. Rather, he lives and dies to unite people to God and with one another.

Paul says Jesus became like a servant to this goal. He obeyed the command to die on a cross for our benefit (Philippians 2:8). We are now united to God by his sacrifice and bound to one another by his blood. If this is the way of Jesus, his followers likewise must put away all division and humbly serve one another. Paul encourages the Philippians to work hard to make this a reality, as God works in them for their joy (Philippians 2:12-13).

Where Is the Gospel?

In the Garden, the serpent tempted Adam and Eve with the prospect of becoming equal with God (Genesis

3:5). Yet what they got instead was division, corruption, and chaos. While reaching for joy, Adam and Eve found themselves separated from God and from others. From the very beginning of the Bible, humanity has been tempted to serve themselves. Seeking our own interests, pursuing selfish ambition, demanding that others serve us—these are second nature for us.

But where our rebellion brings division, Jesus brings unity. He already had equality with God. And yet, he chose to move towards us and enter a world full of hostility. He became flesh and blood to share in our humanity (Hebrews 2:14). Jesus became one with us, so that he could invite us into unity with God and be our example of how to be united with each other. Through his death and resurrection, he mends our relationship with God and others.

No one has humbled themselves like Jesus. In love, Jesus lays it all aside to bring us joy. And now Jesus is enthroned next to God because of his humility and how he lowered himself (Philippians 2:9). Because he was willing to make himself nothing, all creation will bow to his power and authority (Philippians 2:10-11). The way to joy is not through trampling over one another and demanding what we think we deserve. Joy is found by embracing the way of Jesus, putting away division and becoming a servant (Matthew 20:26-28).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who made himself nothing to rescue us. And may you see Jesus as the one who is exalted because of his humility."

Paul worries that his work among the Philippian church may have been all for nothing if they fail to live consistently with the teachings of Jesus (Philippians 2:16). He wants them to be filled with the joy that comes from offering their lives to God (Philippians 2:18). Paul has offered his life to serve others and point them to Jesus. And in that sacrifice, he has found great joy (Philippians 2:17). Paul knows if the Philippians follow his example, they will be filled with joy too and shine like stars in the darkness of our world (Philippians 2:15-16).

Paul tells the Philippians that he is sending his co-workers Timothy and Epaphroditus (Philippians 2:19, 25). These men embody the sacrifice Paul is calling the church to. Just as Jesus humbled himself and laid down his life for their joy, so Timothy and Epaphroditus have made sacrifices for the Philippian church.

Timothy genuinely loves and cares for them. He’s not a man who demands his own way, but seeks the will of Jesus in everything. And in Paul’s experience Timothy has proved himself to be a faithful servant of Jesus, and the Philippians would do well to trust him and his example (Philippians 2:20-22).

Likewise, Epaphroditus is a sacrificial man of God. The Philippians had previously sent Epaphroditus to Paul with money and it almost cost him his life (Philippians 2:25, 4:18). Along the way, Epaphroditus got sick and nearly died. But now that he has recovered, all he wants to do is to reunite with his home church (Philippians 2:26-27). Paul encourages the Philippians to welcome and honor Epaphroditus as an example of the joy in risk and service following Jesus demands (Philippians 2:29-30).

Where is the Gospel?

Like Timothy and Epaphroditus, we are called to joyfully pour out our lives in service to others, as sacrifices to God. And as we do so, we will find a deep and lasting joy in Jesus (Philippians 2:16-18). As Jesus says, whenever we lose our life for him, we actually find it (Mark 8:35). Jesus proved this. He surrendered to God’s will to the point of death. He poured out his life as an offering to rescue us and he found eternal resurrection life. We likewise should offer our whole lives to God, by loving and serving those around us.

It might be tempting to skip over this section of Philippians and treat it simply as Paul’s travel plans. But Paul intentionally points to Timothy and Epaphroditus as examples for us. They demonstrate what Paul has talked about up to this point: a life changed by Jesus, resulting in joy. These men seek the interests of others rather than their own (Philippians 2:21). They lay down their lives to serve and love others (Philippians 2:30). Paul calls us not just to learn from those among us who live this way but to also honor and welcome people like this into our lives (Philippians 2:29-30). And in following their example of devotion to Jesus, we will find great joy, no matter the circumstances.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who fills us with joy in sacrifice. And may you see Jesus as the one who poured out his life in service to others.

Some leaders in the Philippian church are trying to discredit Paul and his teachings. Instead, they teach that adherence to certain Jewish practices are necessary for a person to have a right relationship with God. In particular, these teachers demand that followers of Jesus be circumcised; traditionally, the defining mark of Jewish identity. But Paul outright rejects this (Philippians 3:2). He writes that even as a circumcised man himself, he knows his relationship with God is not due to his Jewish identity, but completely dependent upon Jesus (Philippians 3:3).

Before he met Jesus, Paul used to believe just like these teachers. He was an upright and model Jew, and followed the Old Testament law to a “T.” If anyone had a reason to boast in his Jewish identity and religious observance, it was Paul (Philippians 3:4-6). But everything he once saw as earning his relationship with God, he now sees as a loss. Compared to the value of knowing Jesus, everything else is worthless (Philippians 3:7-8). He tells the Philippians that their relationship with God doesn’t come through their own effort to keep a set of laws, but through trusting in Jesus alone. This is what Paul aims for—to trust nothing else but the good news of Jesus’ life, death, resurrection (Philippians 3:9-12).

Paul goes further, people who boast in their circumcision are actually enemies of Jesus. Offering a different path to relationship with God puts you at odds with the way of Jesus (Philippians 3:18-19). Nothing on this earth or in our efforts can make us right with God, only Jesus can. And one day he will return and transform our bodies into something far more glorious than what circumcision can do. And on that day, when Jesus alone transforms our bodies, we will be in relationship with God forever (Philippians 3:20-21).

Where Is the Gospel?

Our hearts are naturally inclined to find hope and confidence outside of Jesus. Whether in our identity, our religious traditions, or our good deeds, we try to add to the work that Jesus accomplished. We can easily believe that if we live as “good” people, then God will love us and accept us. But this isn’t the good news that Jesus taught. In Jesus’ life and ministry, he surrounded himself with the worst kinds of sinners. The religious leaders were scandalized. But Jesus told them he didn’t come to save good people, he came to save sinners (Mark 2:17). If we want a relationship with God, we must come to Jesus alone. We must leave all other identities and traditions behind, and trust his sacrificial death is a free gift that brings us into a relationship with God.

In this passage, Paul lays out his resumé to show us that he had every reason to trust himself. He even claimed to be faultless according to the 613 laws included in the Old Testament. But he had everything upside down. Being right with God isn’t found in what he had to offer. Everything he thought gave him points to make God like him was actually a loss. They distracted him from the fact that all God wanted from him was to trust and follow Jesus (Philippians 3:9-10). As Paul said elsewhere, it is by grace that we are saved through faith. And this is not from ourselves but it is a gift of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). Our hope is never in how good we can be. Our hope is in Jesus who welcomes sinners to be made well in him and into a relationship with God.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who receives us because of the work of Jesus. And may you see Jesus as the one who laid down his life to give us a relationship with God."

Persecution against the church becomes more and more extreme in Jerusalem. King Herod arrests Christian leaders, kills James (the brother of John), and plans to do the same to Peter (Acts 12:2-3). In response, the church prays earnestly for God’s help (Acts 12:5).

Peter is imprisoned just before Passover, when Israel celebrates their deliverance from Egypt by eating a Passover lamb. This lamb is a symbol of how God freed his people in Egypt by letting his judgment pass over their houses because of the blood of the lamb. 

So, just as God saved Israel from captivity and death then, he now comes to Peter’s aid. God responds to the prayers of the church just as he responded to the cries of his people in Egypt (Exodus 2:23).

An angel frees Peter from his chains and leads him to freedom (Acts 12:7). But just as the angel at Passover brought death, Herod orders the prison guards to be killed and is later struck down himself for his pride (Acts 12:19, 22-23).

God saves Peter like he saved Israel. He does this to show his faithfulness and power are still at work as they were in the Exodus. God fights for the church, now called the true Israel (Romans 2:28-29; Galatians 3:16, 29). 

This story is yet another proof given in Acts that God’s authority is no longer in the temple or the former religious systems but in the church. 

Where is the Gospel?

This is good news because all the promises, titles, privileges, and status that God granted Israel after her escape from Egypt are now ours in Christ. Peter himself declares this when he writes that those who believe in Jesus are now “a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession” (1 Peter 2:9). 

These same titles were given to Israel just moments after the first Passover (Exodus 19:5-6). God is now our God and we are now his people (Exodus 6:7). 

But this new Passover brought not only deliverance for the church but judgment against her enemies (Acts 12:23). Jesus conquered our accuser Satan like he conquered Peter’s accuser Herod (Colossians 2:15). Likewise, when Jesus returns he will vindicate his church from all those who opposed and oppressed her (Revelation 17:14). 

God’s enemies enslave us in many ways. Some Christians face literal imprisonment, or at least the threat of governmental or societal chastisement for their beliefs. Many are trapped in prisons of the enemy’s condemning lies, habitual sin, or addiction. The good news is that Jesus is breaking us out of our prisons. 

We were once all headed for the prison of death and the grave (Romans 6:18). But Jesus, as our final Passover lamb, has taken the sentence of our sin, entered the prison of our grave, and broken us free through his death and resurrection.

Or as Peter himself puts it, Jesus makes you his chosen people, “that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light” (1 Peter 2:9).

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who mightily rescues his people from slavery and prison. And may you see Jesus as the one who rescues us by bursting the doors of sin and death to lead us to freedom and life in him."

Jesus offers life even to the most unlikely, but it’s often the most religious who turn Jesus away. 

John presents two stories in John 4. In the first, Jesus prophesies to a Samaritan woman at a well, and in the second, Jesus heals a politician’s son in Capernaum. The Samaritan woman believes that Jesus is the Messiah, and her whole village trusts him as Messiah, too (John 4:41). But in Capernaum, the city responds with skepticism and persecution. 

Jesus knew this would be the case. Right before he arrives, Jesus says that a prophet has no hour in his hometown (John 4:44). After healing the politician’s son, he indicts the crowd for their unbelief (John 4:48). While the Samaritans are eager to trust Jesus at his word, Capernaum just wanted a magic show. 

Jesus tells his disciples to look up and notice that the fields are ripe for harvest  (John 4:35). They need to “look up” because the harvest field isn’t among the Jews but among Samaritans—not among the religious, but among sinners. The Samaritan woman is both of those things.

She has been divorced five times and had been ostracized by her community for sleeping around (John 4:18). As a Samaritan, she was the victim of a long history of segregation and persecution by the Jewish religious majority. Yet this woman of poor reputation is the person Jesus chooses to reveal his identity as the Messiah who gives eternal life.

This woman becomes Jesus’ first missionary. Her entire town believes that Jesus is the Messiah—not because of his miracles but because of his words (John 4:42). While there was hard-heartedness among his own people in Capernaum. Jesus’ message is welcomed by those on the margins. 

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus wants to win over both the outcast sinners and the hard-hearted. After spending two days of ministry among the Samaritans, he intentionally returns to where he knows he will be misunderstood and rejected. 

Jesus wants everyone to trust him. Whether they’re the outcasts of society or the deeply religious. That’s because Jesus is the harvester who has come to collect his harvest wherever it can be found. And Jesus just as Jesus offers living water to the Samaritan woman, anyone who tells Jesus they are thirsty will be satisfied by him (John 4:14).

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see God who sows seeds for eternal life among all people. And may you see Jesus as the great harvester who harvests souls no matter where they are found."

The last acts of Jesus prepare his disciples for what’s to come. The disciples need to know that Jesus is alive. They need to know the Holy Spirit will equip them for the task ahead. And they need to know Peter is still the one appointed to lead this effort.

Mary Magdalen discovers Jesus’ tomb empty just before dawn. She runs and tells the disciples, and Peter and John race to see for themselves (John 20:1-2). They find Jesus’ grave empty and finally realize that, like Lazarus, Jesus was always meant to die and rise again. 

But Jesus does not first appear to Peter and John. In Mary’s grief and confusion, he approaches her and sweetly says one word—her name (John 20:16). Mary turns around and clings to him. Jesus appoints her as the first witness to his resurrection (John 20:17). 

Later, Jesus appears to his disciples and commissions them as the Father commissioned him (John 20:21). Before, Jesus had washed their feet to point toward his cleansing work on the cross. Now, Jesus breathes on them, pointing forward to the coming of the Holy Spirit who will empower them to proclaim the good news (John 20:22-23). 

But some don’t believe. Thomas refuses to get his hopes up unless he sees Jesus for himself. One week later, Jesus appears behind a locked door and singles him out. Jesus invites him to see and touch his scars (John 20:26-27). He tells Thomas that eternal life is based on faith, not sight.

Jesus appears one final time to the disciples while they are out catching fish.

Jesus had called Peter to lead the disciples, but Peter had openly denied Jesus. Jesus restores Peter by symbolically undoing his three denials with three confessions of love and gives Peter three commissions to care and lead God’s people (John 21:15).

Where is the Gospel?

It’s good news that we are sent to tell good news. Jesus sent Mary to the disciples with the news of the empty tomb. Jesus sent the disciples with the promise of the Spirit. Jesus sends Thomas with hope for doubters.  And Jesus sends Peter to establish the church. This is good news for people like us because we are people like them—the grieving, fearful, doubting, and denying. 

Jesus' resurrection takes people like us and turns us into new creations. Like Mary, we announce that the tomb is empty to people who have not yet heard it. Like the disciples, we are filled with God’s Spirit to announce the forgiveness of sins. Like Thomas, we are armed with eyewitness testimony for doubters. Like Peter, we are commissioned to lead in our circles of influence to glorify God in both life and death.

As John would say, there’s so much more we could say about the work of Jesus in his day and ours—but not even the internet is big enough to hold it all (John 21:25)!

Jesus arrives in Jerusalem like a king. The crowds cheer and lay down their cloaks as Jesus passes. His disciples shout and sing that Jesus is the long-awaited King of Peace (Luke 19:38). The Pharisees hurl accusations (Luke 19:39). And Jesus weeps for a city he knows will reject him and the peace he brings (Luke 19:42). 

When Jesus arrives at the temple, he kicks out the people selling sacrifices and condemns the religious establishment for perverting God’s temple (Luke 19:46). Jesus, like a conquering king, enters the temple and establishes new laws. 

The religious leaders are furious and want to destroy Jesus and his reputation. Three times, they publicly challenge Jesus and his authority with questions designed to trick him (Luke 20:20). But each time they try to undermine him, Jesus counters with a question or parable that undermines their legitimacy and highlights his own. 

Jesus’ parable casts the chief priests as murderous tenants, willing to kill to protect their own interests (Luke 20:19). And Jesus’ questions go consistently unanswered because answering them would either admit that Jesus was sent from God or reveal the Pharisees’ ulterior motives (Luke 20:5-6). In fear, Jesus’ enemies withdraw and refuse to engage him anymore (Luke 20:40). 

But Jesus presses in. He poses another question about the identity of the Messiah that they are again unable to answer (Luke 20:41, 44). He then attacks the scribes for their flamboyance while blessing a widow for her poverty (Luke 20:46, 21:3).

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus isn’t just another revolutionary who traces his lineage back to King David (Luke 3:31). Jesus is God himself. 

This is why Jesus asks the scribes how the Christ can be both David’s son and also David’s Lord. David was the king, and the title “Lord” implies superiority. A king would not call their son “Lord” unless the son was somehow a greater king than them. Jesus is asserting that his authority isn’t just hereditary; it’s divine. Jesus is both a son of David and the Son of God. 

This is good news because it means Jesus has both the authority to overturn the Pharisees’ system of buying and selling sacrifices and the power to offer a better way. By his kingly authority, Jesus destroys the institutions of his enemies and the corrupt rich (Luke 20:18). And by his kingly power, he elevates the humble. He purchases for the poor a forgiveness they could never afford and offers it for free. That’s why Jesus drove out the sellers. In his kingdom, access to God and forgiveness of sin is not bought with money, but like the woman with the two pennies, by humbly offering everything we have.

All he requires is his people choosing to sit, listen, and obey him.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jesus sends out seventy-two new disciples (Luke 10:1). That number refers back to Genesis 10 where seventy nations are listed after the tower of Babel falls. It’s Luke’s way of signaling that the gospel of God’s kingdom is for all nations, not just Israel. 

Contrary to James and John, who wanted to pray down fire on a Samaritan city, Jesus promises that it will be Jewish cities that face a fate worse than the foreign city Sodom (Luke 10:13).

The seventy-two return, rejoicing that even demons obey the name of Jesus on their lips (Luke 10:17). Jesus calls them to rejoice even more that they, as symbolic representatives of formerly hostile nations, are now written into God’s book of life (Luke 10:20). Anyone, not just Jews, who loves God and loves their neighbor will be written in.

But a lawyer, wanting to justify his privileged place in God’s book of life, asks Jesus to clarify who his neighbor is. He expects Jesus to respond with something like, “Your family, friends, and fellow Israelites” (Luke 10:29). Being a lawyer, he had ample evidence for each. Instead, Jesus responds with a story.

Robbers leave a man for dead on the side of a road. A priest and Levite are unneighborly compared to the generosity and compassion of a Samaritan (Luke 10:33). The Samaritans were religious and ethnic outsiders. That’s part of the reason James and John were so willing to burn one of their villages down. So when Jesus casts a hated minority as the hero, he’s revealing that citizens of the kingdom of God can come from anywhere. Anyone who loves God and neighbor can come in!

This is why our passage ends with two women—one anxiously shuffling around and another sitting and listening to Jesus’ words (Luke 10:39-40). Sitting at the feet of Jesus, Mary recognized what Martha, the lawyer, and so many Jewish cities did not. Jesus was not just a teacher of the word of God, but the Word of God himself. Sitting at Jesus’ feet was to love God, and to listen to Jesus’ words was to honor him like the Samaritan loved his neighbor.

Where is the Gospel?

This is good news for all of us—whether Jew, Gentile, or Samaritan. Jesus does not require exhibits A-Z of good deeds like the lawyer had ready. Jesus does not require our service like Martha anxiously offered. Jesus requires neither purity of blood nor religious pedigree. What Jesus requires is choosing to sit, listen, and obey him. 

We can rejoice because all names and nations are written in heaven on that basis, not based on our own busyness or self-righteousness. No person and no nation is beyond the reach of Jesus’ ability save (Luke 10:22). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who saves all nations. And may you see Jesus as the one who invites everyone to sit at his feet and hear his good news."

Their neediness, not their religious performance, is all they need to be accepted by God.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jesus’ kingdom includes people you don’t expect, and it excludes people you do. 

Jesus preaches to the poor. Jesus grants healing for a Roman centurion’s servant. Jesus raises a widow’s son from the dead. Jesus even forgives a woman whose sins are so notorious they aren’t mentioned. 

John the Baptist sends two disciples to ask Jesus if he’s the Messiah they’ve been expecting (Luke 7:19). Jesus tells John to see the fruit of his ministry—the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, and the dead are raised (Luke 7:22). Those who are poor in body, finance, and status have heard and experienced good news through Jesus’ words.

The Pharisees resist this message (Luke 7:30). They aren’t comfortable with the people Jesus attracts. Instead, the Pharisees refuse to identify with sinners and the poor. They refuse to honor Jesus even with basic courtesies. And so, they close themselves off to the forgiveness of their sins, the healing that Jesus brings, and the good news of God’s kingdom.

Jesus explains these varied responses through a parable. Jesus is like a farmer, sowing his seed generously. Jesus lavishes this seed across sidewalks, rocks, weeds, and fields. Everyone receives this good news, but not all accept it (Luke 8:7-8). Many hear and receive the word of Jesus with joy, but others are too proud to admit they need Jesus’ good news at all.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus promises that everything hidden will come to light (Luke 8:17). The Pharisees reveal their hidden pride in their disbelief and corruption. The poor, the sinner, and the foreigner reveal their humility by their healing and salvation. And Jesus reveals his hidden identity by his authority to condemn the Pharisees, heal the poor and forgive the sinful.

This is good news. Whoever comes to Jesus knowing they have nothing and knowing they need forgiveness will be forgiven, healed and called the greatest in the kingdom of heaven (Luke 7:28). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who provides for the poor by sending his Son. And may you see Jesus as the one who proclaims and establishes a kingdom of healing and forgiveness for all who call on him in need."

Through Jesus, we don't have to be blind like the Pharisees. Through Jesus, we can experience the overturning of Satan's kingdom and the establishment of God's kingdom in our lives.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The Pharisees accuse Jesus of demonic activity, but Jesus points out what’s really going on in their hearts.  Some accuse Jesus of casting out demons with the power of demons (Luke 11:15). But Jesus points out how ridiculous it would be for a prince to destroy his own kingdom (Luke 11:18).

Jesus’ exorcisms are not proof of satanic conspiracies but evidence that God’s kingdom has arrived with Jesus and his followers. Just like Pharaoh was disarmed by the “finger of God” (Exodus 8:19) and Israel plundered the Egyptians as they left their slavery, so the coming of God’s kingdom brings rescue to anyone in slavery to demonic powers. This type of liberation is available to anyone who hears God’s word and keeps it (Luke 11:28).

Not everyone who heard Jesus believed him. They wanted to see more signs before they committed. But Jesus does not owe them that. Like Solomon and Jonah, neither of whom performed miracles, his message was enough. The people of Nineveh repented in dust and ashes at Jonah’s eight-word sermon (Jonah 3:4). The Queen of Sheba recognized God’s kingdom simply by hearing Solomon’s wisdom, and neither needed supernatural signs. Jesus is exposing the Pharisees and sign-seekers as worse than Nineveh. A prophet greater than either Solomon or Jonah had arrived, and they say he’s filled with demons (Luke 11:31).

Jesus says the crowd’s unwillingness to repent is like having eyes that don’t see. Healthy eyes see clearly (Luke 11:34). People who see Jesus clearly are freed from the powers of darkness and filled with light. But people who refuse to repent—who refuse to recognize Jesus—are filled with darkness worse than wicked Nineveh.

So Jesus pronounces six “woes” against the religious elite’s self-promotion and hypocritical neglect of justice. Don’t miss the irony. Jesus is insinuating that their pride and violence reveal they are the ones in league with the powers of darkness. If they continue to blind themselves to Jesus, they will be held accountable for killing God’s prophets all the way back to Abel (Luke 11:51). It’s as if Jesus is saying that all the unjust murders of history will culminate in the death of God’s final prophet, Jesus. 

Where is the Gospel?

Before Jesus engages demons or Pharisees, he teaches his disciples how to pray (Luke 11:1). The prayer he teaches is simple. Ask and it will be given. There are no complicated words or rituals. It’s as simple as a child asking his father for a snack (Luke 11:11). 

God, like a good father, promises to feed us with exactly what we need—the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13). This might not always be what we ask for, but it’s exactly what we need. It’s exactly what the demonized man needed—a Spirit of freedom to liberate him from slavery. It’s exactly what the sign-seekers needed—an illuminating Spirit to open their blind eyes. It’s exactly what the Pharisees needed—a holy Spirit to change their murderous hearts. The gift of the Holy Spirit is the perfect answer to the prayer Jesus teaches his disciples to ask, “God’s kingdom come and God’s will be done.”

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God as a good Father who answers our prayers. And may you see Jesus as the one who brings the kingdom of God through the power of the Holy Spirit."

Because Jesus has risen from the dead, he can grant sight to those who are spiritually blind.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening in Luke 24? 

At this moment, all that Luke’s readers know is that Jesus is dead. His body is wrapped in linen and buried in a tomb, sealed with a great stone (Luke 23:53).  In the final chapter of his book, Luke wants to drill in the amazing claim he’s about to make.

Luke 24 begins by telling us that several women who had followed Jesus went home to prepare spices and ointments that traditionally accompany a Jewish burial. Just like the disciples, these women had heard Jesus say that he would rise from the dead (Luke 9:22). Their act, though loving, shows a level of blindness. 

When they arrive at the tomb, they discover it empty and two angels speak to them (Luke 24:3). The angels ask the women why they are looking for the living among the dead, and then remind the women that Jesus said he would rise from the dead (Luke 24:6). The women, no longer spiritually blind to the resurrection, share this good news with the disciples. But the disciples will also need to receive new spiritual sight (Luke 24:11).

Luke interrupts this story to share a similar encounter. Two of Jesus’ followers are traveling down a road when the resurrected Jesus begins walking next to them (24:15). Like the women and the apostles, they’re unable to recognize Jesus at first (Luke 24:16). These disciples knew the details of the Gospel story, yet they did not see the bigger truth within it (Luke 24:19, 21).

Much like the angels rebuked the women, Jesus rebuked his disciples, saying they had forgotten the Scriptures (Luke 24:25). He then walks them through the Old Testament Scriptures and shows how everything points toward his death and resurrection (Luke 24:27). At the high point in the story, Jesus supernaturally opens their eyes, making them see and believe what he had taught them (Luke 24:31).

Finally, Jesus appears to the apostles, who are also slow to see and believe. (Luke 24:37). Again, Jesus rebukes their doubt (Luke 24:38) and shows them how his death and resurrection can be found all throughout the Old Testament Scriptures (Luke 24:44). As with all the others, it wasn’t until Jesus “opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures” that they could see and believe what they were hearing (Luke 24:45). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Everyone is blind to the good news of Jesus until he opens our eyes and our minds to see and believe. The good news is that God promises to open our eyes and minds if we ask (Romans 10:13). 

After opening the disciples’ minds, Jesus tells them that God will send the Holy Spirit so that they can proclaim the Gospel to all nations (Luke 24:49). The Holy Spirit would empower those who hear their message to believe, just like he did for them (Acts 2:4). 

The Holy Spirit helps us to believe, to overcome doubt, and to see Jesus in all of Scripture. As our eyes are opened, we see Jesus in all the Bible—we see Christ who suffered on the cross and rose from the dead in order to forgive our sins (Luke 24:46-47). 

Believing in a risen Jesus is hard, and believing our sins are forgiven is often harder. Yet this shows us why the resurrection is a matter of spiritual sight. Jesus’ resurrection validates everything he said and accomplished. Because Jesus was raised, we are saved. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who fills every page of Scripture with evidence of his Son. And may you see Jesus as the one whose death and resurrection accomplished the unbelievable—our salvation."

The Pharisees grumble that Jesus has surrounded himself with tax collectors and sinners (Luke 15:2). Jesus responds to their grumbling with three parables about a lost sheep, a lost coin, and a lost son. Each ends with a celebration when what was lost is found. But the parable of the lost son ends with an older brother grumbling and refusing to celebrate his once-lost-now-found younger brother (15:28). 

Cleverly, Jesus cast the grumbling Pharisees as the angry older brother in his parable. While everyone celebrates the lost being found, the Pharisees can only stew (Luke 15:29). They believe their moral behavior means 

they

 should be celebrated, not these sinners who repent.

The father responds to his older son’s anger by reminding him that everything he owns is already his (15:31). Since he’s the rightful heir, he does not need to feel jealous that his father’s affection is being spent lavishly on his repentant brother. Just like the lost coin and the lost sheep, anyone who loves the Father will celebrate when what was once dead is found alive (15:32). 

This final parable is a warning to the Pharisees. If they continue to grumble and refuse to celebrate when sinners are saved, they will prove they have never loved God or the people he calls his family. The grumbling Pharisees, like the grumbling Israelites in the wilderness, will be judged for their lack of faith.

Where is the Gospel?

God is a generous and lavish Father toward prodigal sons. Like a shepherd, he will walk into the night to find his lost sheep. Like a diligent woman, he will sweep and seek until he finds his treasure. There are no lengths, heights, or depths he is unwilling to travel to find his people (Ephesians 3:18). 

Jesus shows us that our heavenly Father is even willing to rescue sheep trapped in the valley of death. Jesus dies so he can proclaim good news to those who, like the prodigal, are already dead in their sins (Ephesians 2:1). Because of Jesus’ resurrection, there is no death, life, power, demon, or future in all of creation that can separate us from God’s lavish love and his celebration over us (Romans 8:38). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who is an extravagant Father. And may you see Jesus as the one who spent his life to make the dead alive and the lost found."

The Jewish leaders are ready to kill Jesus over his claims to be the Son of God (Luke 22:71). The problem is that they have no authority to kill him on their own. So they try to brand Jesus as a political threat to Rome. (Luke 23:1-2). But over and over again, Jesus is declared innocent. 

Pilate says Jesus has done nothing wrong three times (Luke 23:4, 14, 22). Herod says that Jesus is innocent (Luke 23:15). A crowd chants for Jesus to be crucified, and they demand he be killed instead of a murderer and terrorist (Luke 23:18-19). When Jesus is hung on the cross, the criminal next to him recognizes he has done nothing to deserve execution (Luke 23:41). At the moment Jesus dies, the centurion presiding over Jesus’ crucifixion worships God and declares that Jesus is not only innocent but 

righteous

 (Luke 23:47).

Just as Jesus prophesied, he was treated and “numbered among the transgressors” (Luke 22:37). He died like a criminal, having done nothing wrong. 

A man named Joseph buried Jesus on “the day of Preparation” (Luke 23:54). It was the day when all the loose ends at work were tied up and all meals were prepared so that Israel could rest on the Sabbath. Jesus’ body, like Israel, was prepared for rest.

Where is the Gospel?

When Jesus dies, the curtain in the temple is torn in two (Luke 23:45). The curtain divided the sinful world from God’s holy presence. Jesus dies, condemned as a sinner. But in that moment, everything that kept transgressors from entering God’s presence was torn down. 

Because of our sin, the innocent Jesus was declared guilty. Yet because of his innocence, we who were guilty are now declared righteous. Jesus bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to our transgressions and live fully forgiven in God’s presence (1 Peter 2:24).

Just as God worked for six days and then rested on the Sabbath when his work was complete, so Jesus completes his work at his death and rests on the Sabbath too. Paul writes that at the moment Jesus died, he made everyone who trusts in him new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17). 

In other words, when the Sabbath is over a new week begins. Jesus rising from the dead means God is no longer at rest. He is working. Offering resurrection life and making new creations of everyone who gives their guilt to Jesus and receives his perfect innocence. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who creates and rests. And may you see Jesus as the one who makes us new creations who can live in God’s presence."

When his blood is spread on the cross, we have a better salvation than what was purchased in Egypt.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jesus spends his last night on earth preparing his disciples for his death. And he does it over a Passover meal. 

The Passover celebrated God’s rescue of Israel out of Egypt. For thousands of years the Israelites ate lamb and bread and drank wine as reminders of God’s rescue from Pharoah. But Jesus tells his disciples that these symbols no longer point back, but forward to him (Luke 22:19-20). Like the bread was broken, Jesus will be broken. Like the lamb was sacrificed, Jesus will be sacrificed. And like the wine was poured out, Jesus’ blood will be spilled. 

Jesus says this will all happen because of a traitor (Luke 22:21). The disciples start fighting about which of them is most likely to betray Jesus, and their argument devolves into a contest about who is the greatest disciple (Luke 22:24). Jesus rebukes them. He tells them that the greatest is the least. The last is the first. Greatness is not gained by how many serve them but how many they serve (Luke 22:27). 

Jesus then warns them that following him is about to get much more difficult. A demonic power has overtaken Judas and is hunting Peter (Luke 22:31). Jesus prophesies Peter will deny him three times (Luke 22:34). Jesus is warning them that the peaceful days and ways of Jesus’ ministry are over (Luke 22:36). 

The disciples misunderstand Jesus and think this means fighting. Jesus tells them to drop it (Luke 22:38). But when Judas arrives to betray Jesus, one of them cuts off the ear of the high priest’s servant (Luke 22:50). Jesus rebukes them again and heals his accuser as they arrest him (Luke 22:51). Peter follows Jesus to the high priest’s house, only to deny knowing Jesus three times (Luke 22:61). 

Each of Jesus’ prophecies comes true. Judas betrays him. He is arrested like a transgressor of Roman and Jewish law. Peter denies him three times. Ironically, the men who arrested Jesus blindfold him and mock him as a prophet, asking him who’s beating him (Luke 22:64).  

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus is not just a prophet, but the prophesied one. Jesus secures a final Exodus that saves Israel from death and transgression by becoming the Passover lamb and becoming a transgressor for us (Luke 22:37). 

Because Jesus is willing to have his blood poured out like wine and his body torn like bread, death passes over us like it did for Israel in Egypt. Isaiah 53:12 says that Jesus “bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.” This is why Jesus prayed over Peter, who denied him three times (Luke 22:32). It’s why Jesus forgave the soldiers who nailed him to the cross (Luke 23:34), and why he promised the thief hanging next to him that he would enter paradise (Luke 23:43). Jesus is the prophesied Passover lamb who becomes like a transgressor and criminal. His death in our place has uniquely qualified him to pray for us and save us.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who promised full and final deliverance for his people. And may you see Jesus, who was numbered among the transgressors so that through his sacrifice, sin and death might pass over us."

In his death, Jesus established a kingdom that will remain stable forever.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jesus tells his disciples about the kind of suffering they can expect in their lifetime (Luke 21:32). Jesus boldly predicts: Jerusalem and the temple will fall (Luke 21:6, 24). This would have been shocking if not blasphemous news to the Jews. Jerusalem and the temple represented the center of God’s plan for salvation. Predicting their destruction was like predicting that God would abandon his people and break his promises. 

Jesus warns his disciples that not even they will be immune to the coming wars. God will empower them, but they should expect persecution and suffering during their lifetime (Luke 21:12, 32).

All of these prophecies were fulfilled in the book of Acts (which you can read about in Acts 5:40-41) and ultimately when the Roman army sacked Jerusalem in A.D. 70. The purpose of these warnings is to encourage Jesus’ disciples that their perseverance as they wait for the Son of Man will lead to redemption and rescue (Luke 21:28). 

Throughout this passage, Jesus uses powerful cosmic language to talk about events in human history (21:25). In The Old Testament, the prophets did the same. They described “signs in the heavens” as a way to talk about cities and nations falling into enemy hands (Isaiah 13:10; 24:23; Ezekiel 32:7; Joel 2:10, 31; 3:15).

And one of the most powerful images Jesus uses is from the book of Daniel where the Son of man is seen “coming on the clouds” (Luke 21:27, Daniel 7:13).

Where is the Gospel?

When Jesus predicted the fall of Jerusalem, many Jews would have concluded that God had abandoned his people and the end of the world was coming. Naturally, they would have been tempted to despair (Luke 21:26). But Jesus comforts them by saying that while nations, cities, and even temples fall, Jesus’ kingdom and his words will remain stable forever (Luke 21:33). 

God’s promises won’t be fulfilled by preserving Jerusalem or the temple; they will be fulfilled in Jesus. Just as Daniel saw a son of man crushed by a beast before rising to power, so Jesus is the man who is killed by human evil, overcomes death, and is exalted to God’s right hand in the clouds. Unlike a city that can be overthrown or a temple that can be burned down, Jesus himself will be the new, unconquerable temple. And since his death and resurrection conquered the kingdom of death and the fires of Hell, everyone who remains faithful through their own persecution and death will stand next to the Son of Man in a new Jerusalem forever (Luke 21:36).

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who keeps his promises and never abandons his people. And may you see Jesus as our indestructible temple who secures for us an eternal Jerusalem."

The Pharisees want to know when God’s kingdom will come (Luke 17:20). Jesus doesn’t give a straight answer. He hints that God will take away the faithful from destruction when the Son of Man is revealed (Luke 17:30). Just as Noah was saved by the ark (Luke 17:26),  the disciples ask where they can go to escape destruction. Cryptically, Jesus says that their ark will be a corpse (Luke 17:37). The faithful will be saved when they’re taken to a body. 

The disciples worry about what this might mean. Jesus encourages his disciples to pray and not lose heart. God will rescue them. But  Jesus then wonders aloud, “Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth (Luke 18:8)?” 

Luke then layers story after story to show us the parables and encounters of Jesus about the unlikely people who will find God’s kingdom. A Samaritan leper, a widow, two tax collectors, a blind man, and a rowdy group of children are models of faithful people who will enter God’s kingdom. But the character most like the Pharisees—a rich, moral young ruler—chooses money over following Jesus (Luke 18:24). The point is simple: Faithfulness is not found where the Pharisees expect.

Jesus ends this conversation about God’s kingdom with a parable. A master leaves his estate to his servants while he inherits a new kingdom far away. When he returns, he finds that his faithful servants have wisely invested his money while the faithless buried it, never imagining it could grow. 

The faithless servants are the Pharisees. They grumble under their master’s generous rule (Luke 19:14). They resent the fact that the master’s generosity is being given to people they deem unworthy (Luke 19:25). Like the older brother in the story of the prodigal son, they were disgusted that people like Zaccheus could receive God’s mercy (Luke 19:7). Jesus promises that people like them will be destroyed.

Where is the Gospel?

The consequences for not being faithful when the Son of Man returns are disastrous (Luke 19:27). Just like the fire that destroyed Sodom or Noah’s flood, judgment is inescapable. Our only hope is to be taken from it. Like the disciples, we should ask, “Where can we go?”

Jesus answers our question with good news, even if it doesn’t sound like it. “Where there is a body, the vultures will gather (Luke 17:37).” Jesus is not talking about the habits of birds of prey. He is talking about where we can go to escape judgment. He is talking about his death and his body. 

Jesus told the Pharisees that before the kingdom comes, the Son of Man would die (Luke 17:25). Before the flood, an ark was built, and before God’s judgment, a cross will be built. Jesus is explaining that the way we escape judgment and enter into his kingdom is not by trusting a boat’s engineering but by trusting that Jesus’ death will protect us from God’s judgment. If we give up all we have like Zaccheus, run to Jesus like children, and call out for mercy like a blind man, we will be saved.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who judges the pride of the Pharisees. And may you see Jesus as the one who dies in order to rescue us from judgment."

Luke’s opening words tell us what we’re about to read—eyewitness testimonies that give us certainty that Jesus is Messiah (Luke 1:4). 

The first eyewitnesses are Zechariah and Mary. They both receive incredible promises from God through a messenger (Luke 1:11, 26). An angel announces to both families that they would have children under impossible circumstances. 

Elizabeth will become pregnant after decades of infertility, and Mary (a virgin) will carry God’s Son (Luke 1:18, 27). John will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and Jesus will be born because of the Holy Spirit. John will fill a prophetic role like Elijah, and Jesus will be a king like David, and his kingdom will never end (Luke 1:66).

As a pair, the birth stories tell us that John’s ministry will prepare Israel for Jesus. And Jesus’ ministry will prepare Israel for God’s Kingdom.

The miraculous events surrounding Jesus’ birth prove this. An army of angels announces the birth of Jesus to some poor shepherds, who see, rejoice, and act as the first witnesses to Jesus’ birth (Luke 2:9).

A few days later, Simeon and Anna encounter Jesus in the temple and praise God for the child, singing over him and speaking of “the redemption of Jerusalem” (Luke 2:28).

Where is the Gospel?

None of us want to believe lies. Luke shows us that our faith has a firm foundation in recorded historical events and eyewitness testimony. And every witness in Luke declares the same thing—God has come to rescue and to save. 

Gabriel calls this child, “the Son of God” (Luke 1:32). The angelic army calls him “Savior,” “Messiah,” and “the Lord” (Luke 2:11). Simeon calls him, “God’s salvation” (Luke 2:30)  And in a final story from his boyhood, Jesus himself refers to God’s temple as, “My Father’s house” (Luke 2:49) 

This good news isn’t just for Israel. The angelic army announced that this is good news of great joy for 

all

 people. Simeon sings that Jesus will be a light to the Gentiles (Luke 2:32). 

Luke has just begun his Gospel account, but he is already pointing us toward the global impact of Jesus’ historically verifiable life, death, and resurrection. This is good news meant for everyone to hear.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who remembers and keeps his promises. And may you see Jesus as the Son of God and Savior of the world."

Jesus answers three questions in our passage today: What is the kingdom of God like (Luke 13:18)? Who will enter that kingdom (Luke 13:23)? And what will it take to be a citizen of God’s kingdom and Jesus’ disciple (Luke 14:27)?

Jesus answers the first question by healing two sick people on the Sabbath. The Sabbath was meant to celebrate God freeing Israel from its bondage. So Jesus frees a sick woman and liberates a diseased man (Luke 13:16; 14:4). Like a mustard seed bursting out of the ground or a lump of dough slowly growing these healings are evidence that God’s kingdom is unexpectedly and subtly arriving. 

So the crowds wonder who will enter God’s kingdom of rest and freedom. Jesus tells them that the kingdom’s citizens won’t be the people who assume they’ve already arrived or have a privileged place in God’s history. People who knock on the door once it’s closed will find it locked from the inside (Luke 13:25). Those who sit in the best seats at banquet tables will be asked to sit somewhere else (Luke 14:9). Those who turn down wedding invitations will find their seats given to the lame, blind, and crippled (Luke 14:21). 

Each of these parables is a rebuke to the Pharisees’ presumption that their lack of compassion for sinners and the poor could never take away their position as “God’s chosen people.” Jesus warns them that those who consider themselves first will be last, and everyone they’ve considered last will take their place as the first citizens in the kingdom of God (Luke 13:30). 

So what is Jesus looking for in citizens of this kingdom? What will it take to be his disciple? Jesus says it will be hard. It will be like squeezing through a narrow doorway, carrying crosses, and renouncing everything you have (Luke 13:24; 14:27, 33). It will mean humbling yourself entirely in order to be exalted (Luke 14:11). 

Where is the Gospel?

If you are sick, poor, disabled, oppressed, or marginalized, you already know what it means to be the least. Your life has already humbled you. The good news is that Jesus’ invitation to experience salvation, healing, liberation, and honor comes to you—the last—first. 

Normally, the religious, rich, and privileged don’t understand and are unwilling to help. But Jesus is different. Jesus made friends with sinners while never sinning. Jesus’ wealth could not be measured, but he left it behind to sympathize with the poor. Jesus is the first over all creation, but he became the least so he could save it. Jesus the great renounced everything to make us, the least, into his disciples. Now Jesus invites all of us, whether rich or poor, to follow him.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the great God whose kingdom comes first to the least. And may you see Jesus as the one who humbled himself so that the least might be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."

Jesus doesn't succumb to temptation but opens the door to a new and better creation for all people.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What's Happening?

Luke tells us that John the Baptist is the long-prophesied messenger who will prepare the way of the Lord (Isaiah 40:3).

John comes with a message of repentance and judgment. He calls for upright character and humble hearts. He speaks boldly against those in power, even though this will eventually kill him. John baptizes his followers as a sign of repentance and separation from past sins (Luke 3:3).

But John says that someone else is coming who will provide a baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire (Luke 3:16). John warns that world-altering events are coming like a fire, and they will either refine us or destroy us.

Jesus comes with the crowds to be baptized by John. But as he comes out of the water, Luke says that the heavens open and the Spirit rests on Jesus like a dove (Luke 3:21). A loud voice from heaven declares, “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased” (Luke 3:22).

Luke then backs up this heavenly claim with a genealogy stretching all the way back to Adam, the very first “son of God” (Luke 3:38).

The Holy Spirit then leads Jesus into the wilderness where he’s tempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-2). The devil quotes from the Hebrew Scriptures to justify Jesus’ abandoning his mission, but in each case Jesus rebukes him with words from Deuteronomy. The devil leaves Jesus, looking for a more opportune moment (Luke 4:13).

Where is the Gospel?

Luke connects the role of John the Baptist with the words of Isaiah. He prophesied that all people would see the salvation of God. When Simeon held baby Jesus in the temple, he had declared that his eyes had seen God’s salvation (Luke 2:30). And when John baptizes Jesus, God himself affirms it.

Jesus is God’s long-awaited salvation.

From the moment of his baptism, Luke describes Jesus as filled with the Holy Spirit. The rest of Jesus’ ministry happens by the leading and empowering of the Holy Spirit (Luke 3:22).

After his resurrection, Jesus tells his followers that this Spirit will live in them, too (Acts 1:8). Through faith in Jesus, we are filled with and led by his Spirit. We can now live like Jesus, secure in our identity as God’s children and empowered by his divine presence.

Jesus makes this possible because he is a better Adam and a better son of God. What Adam could not resist even once while in a lush garden, Jesus refused three times in a barren wilderness. Jesus succeeds where Adam failed. 

Paul says this is good news because just as Adam’s disobedience as a son of God stained all humanity, Jesus’ obedience as the true Son of God washes them clean from all sin (1 Corinthians 15:22).

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is pleased with his Son. And may you see Jesus as the new and better Adam who succeeds where we fail so we can be called children of God."

He shows us that death and suffering are the paths to true life.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Luke wants you to see Jesus’ miracles and wrestle with the question “Who is Jesus?”

Jesus rebukes a storm and casts out demons. He heals a chronically ill woman who touches his clothes and raises a dead girl with his touch. He miraculously feeds five thousand men plus women and children. He even delegates his authority to his disciples. 

While King Herod wonders who Jesus could be, Peter says clearly Jesus is “the Christ of God” (Luke 9:20). Jesus is the one prophesied in the Old Testament who will save Israel from their sins and proclaim good news to the poor (Luke 4:18). Peter recognizes Jesus as the true successor of King David who will establish God’s kingdom forever.

God confirms this divine identity on a mountain when a bright cloud engulfs Jesus and his disciples. Who is Jesus? The voice from the cloud proclaims, “This is my son, my Chosen One, listen to him” (Luke 9:35).

While Jesus is the Chosen One, his identity will only be validated through his death. Not only that, but anyone who wants to follow him must “take up their cross” and die, too (Luke 9:23). The way we follow Jesus is by dying like Jesus. 

Luke then gives us four examples of the disciples trying to cling to life, power, or authority. They don’t yet understand that following Jesus will cost them everything.

Where is the Gospel?

So why is it good news that we have to lay down our lives to enter the kingdom of God? Why is it good news that we have to surrender everything we hold dear, pick up our cross, and die with Jesus if we want life?

The answer comes when we answer the question, “Who is Jesus?” Peter declares it and God spoke it—Jesus is the Chosen One. He was chosen to become the least so he and anyone who follows him would become great in the kingdom of heaven. 

The disciples didn’t understand this reality. They wanted to compete for greatness and rain down fire on God’s enemies (Luke 9:54). But Jesus tells them that all the Old Testament prophets pointed forward to a far more sacrificial path (Luke 9:58). 

Jesus takes our idea of greatness and turns it on its head, and this is good news because it is the only path that leads to eternal life. Yes, we lose the whole world, but we gain our souls (Matthew 16:26). Jesus was chosen to show that following him into death is the only path to true life.

He accepts us, not because we are rich, but because we trust in him.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jesus has just rebuked the Pharisees for their greed and envy (Luke 11:39-40). He now wants to make sure his disciples don’t make the same mistakes (Luke 12:1). Jesus weaves the themes of judgement and wealth together over and over. He warns his disciples that there is a day coming when every secret, greedy motive will be revealed—so they must live as if that day is right around the corner. 

Jesus says fearing God in this way is the 

only

 way to be filled with his Spirit (Luke 12:5, 8, 12). The Spirit will teach his disciples to hold their possessions loosely. The rich have no reason not to be generous since the day of judgement is near (Luke 12:20). And the poor don’t need to be anxious because God’s Kingdom with all his wealth and treasure is almost here (Luke 12:32)! Since there is a day coming when we will be judged for our greed 

and

 become inheritors of a great Kingdom, we have no reason to be anxious and every reason to be generous (Luke 12:33).

Jesus tells the disciples to imagine this day like servants waiting for their master to come home from a long journey. It’s their job to stay awake and their responsibility to keep the house running. If they don’t, they’ll experience the consequences of their unfaithfulness (Luke 12:46). If they do, then when the master returns home, against every expectation, he promises to serve them, his servants (Luke 12:37). 

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus’ ministry is one of mercy—mercy toward the oppressed poor but also mercy toward the unrepentant rich. His miracles and teachings are second chances to those who have failed to serve and fear the Lord (Luke 12:56). Jesus is like a gardener who wants to give his tree every chance to bear fruit before cutting it down (Luke 13:8-9). 

It’s easy to believe God will never judge us. The crowds that heard Jesus thought the same. They wrongly assumed judgement was only for “truly evil” people like the ones Pilate executed in Galilee (Luke 13:1). But Jesus says only those who recognize their hidden greed and pride and choose to bow before the Lord will escape judgement and become citizens of the Kingdom.

Jesus promises freedom from our anxiety about money and forgiveness for all the ways we’ve been greedy. And the best news of all is that we can have freedom and forgiveness, not because we are rich, but because we are rich in Jesus. Jesus promised to give his Kingdom and his wealth to anyone who repents of their greed and pride and make Jesus their master.

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who is fair to judge the world for its greed and pride. And may you see Jesus generously offering his kingdom to all who turn to him."

Jesus has come to save the poor both materially and spiritually.",Website,Luke Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jesus begins a conversation with his disciples about money using a parable about a dishonest manager who is about to be fired. When the manager finds out, he does everything he can to survive. His boss commends him for his savviness. He knew how to use money to gain what was most valuable to him—survival. 

The conclusion is simple: The way you spend money says a lot about what you value. And Jesus says the more money you have, the more difficult it will be to value God’s kingdom (Luke 18:24). The more money you have, the more tempted you will be to use it in service of a different god (Luke 16:13). 

The Pharisees think this is ridiculous (Luke 16:14). To them, wealth was a sign of God’s blessing (Luke 16:15). Jesus rebukes these experts in God’s law for neglecting what the Torah had always taught. Israel was the least of all nations when God chose them (Deuteronomy 7:7). The story of Israel showed that poverty was a sign of blessing, not wealth.

Jesus tells them a parable about a rich man who refuses to invite a poor man to his table. Both die suddenly. Contrary to what the Pharisees expect, the rich man’s wealth did not indicate a place in paradise. The poor man drinks cool water while the rich man suffers (Luke 16:25). Begging that this message be told to his wealthy brothers, the rich man is told that the Law and the Prophets are clear enough. If they’ve refused to listen to God’s Word about the poor, even a man rising from the dead would not convince them otherwise (Luke 16:31). 

Where is the Gospel?

The Pharisees’ lives revealed that they served money and not God. This is why Jesus mentions John the Baptist. Remember, the Pharisees refused when John told them to be baptized, repent for their sins, and give their away possessions (Luke 3:9-10; Luke 7:29-30). The poor in Israel were being sacrificed on the altar of the Pharisees’ greed. Jesus is warning them that if they do not stop serving money, they can expect to be more like the rich man in Hades than the poor man in paradise. 

Jesus had come to preach good news to the poor (Luke 4:18). That’s why in previous parables, he urgently called the poor, lame and blind to banquets. Jesus was urging every poor and sick person to inherit God’s kingdom (Luke 16:16). And like the loving Father urged the angry older brother to join his prodigal brother’s feast, Jesus is now revealing to the Pharisees that his message is good news for them, too.  

It’s not just the financially poor and physically sick that Jesus has come to save. Everyone who recognizes their poverty and lostness can enter into God’s kingdom, too. The Law and the Prophets and Jesus all agree—material prosperity doesn’t save; it damns. 

The only good news the Pharisees have is that God is generous to the poor. And the Pharisees will see that again when Jesus dies on the cross and rises from the dead. Jesus had and would become poor so that Pharisees through his poverty might become rich (2 Corinthians 8:9). That’s why, if they don’t accept the Prophets, they would never believe Jesus’ resurrection.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who comes to make the poor truly rich. And may you see Jesus, his Son, who became poor so that all who believe in him could be saved."

Jesus begins his ministry in his hometown synagogue and announces, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me” (Luke 4:18). 

By the Holy Spirit’s power, Jesus drives out demonic spirits and heals those sick with fever, paralysis, and leprosy. As he travels from town to town, he summarizes his ministry by saying, “I must proclaim the good news of the Kingdom… for that is why I was sent” (Luke 4:43).

But not everyone welcomes Jesus’ ministry and message. His hometown tries to kill  him after he suggests that God will save and heal Gentiles before Israelites (Luke 4:27-28). Jesus escapes, but the opposition has just begun.

The Pharisees and teachers of the law confront Jesus because he eats with sinners and tax collectors. They accuse him of blasphemy when he heals a paralyzed man and forgives his sins (Luke 5:21). Later, the Pharisees begin plotting to kill Jesus. 

Usually, disciples of a rabbi would follow him and request him to train them. Instead, Jesus goes out and selects disciples himself—and not the kind you would expect. Luke highlights a fisherman and a tax collector, two men on opposite ends of an economic and political spectrum. In both stories, Luke tells us that these men “left everything” to follow Jesus (Luke 5:11, 28).

Jesus begins his ministry by announcing the coming of God’s favor. His words from Isaiah 61 and 58 are connected to the Year of Jubilee, an event that was supposed to happen once every fifty years in Israel’s history when all debts were forgiven and slaves set free (Leviticus 25:10). 

Jesus comes to bring a new and better Jubilee. His body and blood are the cost for total forgiveness, and his resurrection is the power over the bondage of sickness and sin. Jesus demonstrates this power even before his death as he heals the sick and forgives sins. He forgives the sins of a paralytic and then heals the man to validate his authority to forgive (Luke 5:23). Jesus tells the accusing Pharisees that he came, not for those who claimed to be righteous, but for sinners (Luke 5:32).

His reputation as a “friend of sinners” is meant to shame Jesus because religious leaders prided themselves in being separate from corrupt people. But rather than becoming defiled himself, Jesus brings holiness and hope with him as he interacts with sinners of all kinds. From Simon Peter to Levi, we see a Savior who doesn’t deal with sinners from a distance. He meets us where we are and calls us to follow him. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who shows favor to his people. And may you see Jesus as the Spirit-filled Savior who heals and forgives."

The Old Testament encouraged the poor to eat from the edges of farmers’ fields when they were hungry (Deuteronomy 23:25). Jesus and his disciples take advantage of this law and pick some heads of grain as they walk by an open field on the Sabbath (Luke 6:1). But the Pharisees took issue with this. They had added extra laws alongside the Old Testament. These additions included restrictions on gathering grain on the Sabbath (Luke 6:2). 

The Pharisees were so strict on their Sabbath commandments that they objected when Jesus healed a man’s deformed hand on a Sabbath (Luke 6:11). Jesus points out their deep misunderstanding about God’s laws, which are meant to give life, not withhold it (Luke 6:9). In their zeal to obey the law, the Pharisees had lost sight of the purpose of the law—to empower God’s people to love God and love their neighbor. Jesus rebukes the Pharisees for their hypocrisy. 

Jesus then calls twelve disciples together at a mountain, and from there he comes down the mountain and begins teaching the crowds (Luke 6:12). In this, Jesus mirrors Moses, who gathered the twelve tribes of Israel at Mount Sinai and came down with the law of God. As Jesus delivers the law, he highlights the upside-down nature of God’s Kingdom—one that brings blessing to the poor, hungry, and weeping but judgment on the rich, full, and happy (Luke 6:20). Like Moses, Jesus underscores that love of neighbor is the clearest evidence of love for God (Luke 6:31).

Jesus says that healthy people are like healthy trees—they bear fruit (Luke 6:44). When we hate our enemies, refuse to be generous, are stubborn to forgive, or always expect a favor for a favor, we show that we are not God’s people because ultimately we have not loved God (Luke 6:45).

Where is the Gospel?

God gave the law in the Old Testament to bring blessing and life, but no one could keep it (Romans 7:10). Worse, the Pharisees had exchanged the purpose of the law for rote obedience, at the expense of the needy in their community. The law was good, but it could not produce people who could carry it out (Romans 7:11-12). 

But Jesus is the bringer of a better law. He fulfills the entire purpose of the law by upholding all of it, and he does what the law could never do by becoming the pathway to a renewed heart. 

Jesus isn’t just offering a better interpretation of the law; he’s presenting himself 

as

 the better law. He calls people to come to him, hear his words, and do them. Like a house built on a solid foundation, those who do what Jesus says will dwell secure and be blessed (Luke 6:48). The storms of life aren’t able to overcome a house firmly built on a rock. But for those who hear and do not obey, they are like a house built on the sand, just waiting to fall (Luke 6:49).

Jesus is the firm foundation, and he invites those who call him “Lord” to bear fruit that shows their allegiance not only to a written code, but to the flesh and blood life of love manifested in Jesus himself.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who gives us laws to bless us. And may you see Jesus as the one who is the true and better law that leads to life."

Jesus lands on a shore to a massive crowd looking for teaching and healing. Even though he and his disciples are exhausted Jesus has compassion on the crowd and calls them “sheep without a shepherd” (Mark 6:34).

The first time the Bible uses that phrase is in the book of Numbers. Moses asks God to appoint a new leader for Israel so that they “will not be like sheep without a shepherd” (Numbers 27:16-17). In response, God raises up Joshua to succeed Moses. Mark wants us to see Jesus like the “shepherd,” Joshua. And like a good shepherd, Jesus feeds his sheep. 

Jesus miraculously feeds a Jewish crowd of 5000 and a Gentile crowd of 4000 crowds in the wilderness. After each of these miracles, the people question Jesus’ identity.

After feeding the 5,000, Jesus goes away to pray and comes to his disciples by walking on the Sea of Galilee. He passes by them and they are terrified, mistaking him for a ghost. He tells them who he is by referring to himself with the divine, “I Am” (Mark 6:50). 

After feeding the 4,000, the Pharisees demand another sign. They want Jesus to prove himself. But when Jesus fed the masses in the wilderness he was proving that he is the “shepherd” Israel had been hoping for. The Pharisees have hardened their hearts and so he refuses to perform for them.

Between these two feedings, the Pharisees accuse Jesus of food-related sins. His disciples don’t follow the religious custom of washing their hands before they eat, so the Pharisees say they are defiled. Yet Jesus is quick to point out their hypocrisy—the Pharisees prioritize their man-made laws over God’s laws. If anyone is defiled, they are.

Jesus goes on to explain that things on the outside don’t make us unclean. Defilement doesn’t come from unclean hands but from an unclean heart.

Where is the Gospel? 

When Jesus says that the people are like a sheep without a shepherd, he sets himself up to be a new and better Joshua. Jesus will succeed Moses and shepherd Israel into the true promised land. Just like God provided bread and meat in the wilderness for the 12 tribes of Israel, Jesus does the same and provides 12 baskets of leftovers - one for each of the tribes! 

But Jesus isn’t just the Savior of Israel. He is the good shepherd over all the nations.

In Joshua’s day, God’s people were to destroy the seven foreign nations in the promised land (Deuteronomy 7:1). But when Jesus sees the Gentile nations, he has compassion on them just as he had on Israel and produces seven baskets of leftovers—one for each of the seven nations Joshua was supposed to destroy.

Jesus is the true and better shepherd who satisfies not only the 12 tribes of Israel but liberates all the nations of the Gentiles, as well.

Jesus demonstrates his power to satisfy and liberate the nations from the bondage of sin and death as he walks on the water. The Old Testament uses water as a symbol of chaos, evil, and disorder (Genesis 1:2). Jesus offered himself to the waves of death but treads upon them through his resurrection. He has the power to conquer evil and liberate all nations. He stands upon the waters representing evil and disorder in our world and declares, “I Am.”

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who is Jesus. And may you see Jesus as the good shepherd who satisfies and liberates his people."

Jesus is hung on the cross. Jesus cries out some words from Psalm 22 “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” The crowd misunderstand and thinks he’s calling for Elijah to save him (Mark 15:35). Waiting to see if Elijah will take him down, they offer him sour wine on the end of a stick (Mark 15:36).

Jesus cries, gives one final breath, and dies. Immediately, the curtain in the temple is torn from top to bottom. The centurion overseeing Jesus’ execution becomes the first person in Mark to identify Jesus as the Son of God (Mark 15:38-39).

As he dies, a group of female disciples watches from a distance. One of the religious leaders, Joseph of Arimathea, asks Pilate for the body of Jesus. Although the Romans usually left the deceased bodies of criminals as a warning, Pilate grants Joseph’s request so that Jesus can be buried before the Sabbath (Mark 15:44).

The women come to the tomb after the Sabbath to embalm Jesus’ body. However, when they arrive, the tomb is empty. An angel tells them to not be afraid because Jesus has risen from the dead, and they should go and tell the other disciples. The women are frightened, run away, and say nothing (Mark 16:8). And that’s how the Gospel of Mark abruptly ends.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus was separated and forsaken by God so that we would never have to be. Mark’s Gospel records two things that “tear”—the heavens above Jesus at his baptism, and the curtain in the temple at Jesus’ death (Mark 1:10; 15:38).

The temple contained two curtains: one that separated God’s presence from the rest of the temple, and another that separated Gentiles and women from where only Jewish men could worship. Although Mark doesn’t tell us which curtain tore, he tells us that a Gentile is the first person to confess Jesus as the Son of God and women are the first witnesses of his resurrection. When the curtain tore, it was a symbol that the death of Jesus granted access for all people to come into God’s presence.

But why does Mark end so suddenly? Mark ends with the women, who had traveled with Jesus from the beginning, running away from the tomb in fear and telling no one. This ending is supposed to shock us. Its goal is to make us ask “Who is Jesus to me?” 

Like the centurion, do we see Jesus as the exalted Son of God? Or like the women, do we not know what to think and tell no one? Mark leaves his gospel open-ended so that each of us might gauge our own response to the works of Jesus’ life recorded in Mark and the empty tomb.

So, who is Jesus, to you?

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is more powerful than death. And may you see Jesus as the one who was forsaken so you might never be.

-------

**Please note: this devotional does not cover the longer ending to the book of Mark.   

Scholars almost universally agree that Mark 16:9-20 was a later addition to Mark's Gospel. The earliest manuscripts do not include Mark 16:9-20 and they are unknown to a number of church fathers. This section was likely written by a second-century scribe to better make sense of Mark's abrupt ending.  

We believe it's better to let Mark's abrupt ending speak for itself. Rather than tell us explicitly what Jesus' death and resurrection mean, Mark invites us to consider the women's fear in light of our own (Mark 16:8). Will we fear? Will we tell no one? Or with the death-defeated power of Christ right in front of us, will we go into all the world and preach the Gospel?

The book of Mark is about one thing—“The gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1). But Mark doesn’t begin his Gospel with Jesus or his good news; he begins with John the Baptist. 

The prophet Isaiah said that before the Lord would come, a messenger in the wilderness would prepare the way. John is that messenger and his message proclaims that someone is coming who is greater than him (Mark 1:7). John understood that his baptism was an outward sign of renewal, but this coming Lord would bring inward renewal through the Holy Spirit.

This presence of God was confined to the Holy of Holies, inaccessible to all but the high priest, but John declared that it was about to break out and come near. The people should prepare their hearts by repenting for their sins (Mark 1:4). 

While he is preaching, Jesus shows up and is baptized by John. The moment he comes up from the water, the sky is torn open, the Holy Spirit comes down like a dove on Jesus, and a voice from heaven declares that Jesus is the beloved Son who pleases God (Mark 1:11).

 

The renewal that John preached was right in front of him in Jesus.

After withstanding Satan’s temptations, Jesus begins to preach this message, “The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15). 

Jesus then recruits the first citizens of this new Kingdom, four simple fishermen who respond to Jesus’ call to follow him.

It’s helpful to ground yourself in the kingdom language here. God anoints Jesus in the river to begin his reign as king just like Samuel anointed David to be King of Israel (1 Samuel 16:13). 

And just like David defeated Goliath, Jesus defeats Satan (1 Samuel 17:50). The king is anointed. The enemy is defeated. It’s time for the king to reign. 

And like all kings, Jesus recruits an inner circle to carry out the duties of the kingdom. These are Jesus’ disciples (Mark 1:17). 

Where is the Gospel?

Israel had a long history of kings who were called by God but failed to live according to his word. Isaiah and the prophets looked forward in hope to a day when God himself would come and establish his rule in the world. In Jesus, the long-awaited Kingdom has come. 

Mark uses the word “torn” twice in his Gospel account—here, when the heavens are torn open above Jesus, and again when the temple curtain is torn in two. In both cases, God is breaking into the world, first to rest upon Jesus, and then through the death of Jesus to rest upon each of his people. 

The blessing pronounced over Jesus at his baptism is the same affirmation declared over all who believe the Gospel of the Kingdom—that we are beloved children of God (1 John 3:1, John 1:12).

All of this is possible because Jesus, the beloved Son of God, was also the suffering servant Isaiah foresaw. Jesus overcame the temptation of Satan, and instead of embracing power chose to suffer and die. His death forgives our sins, sets us free from evil, and renews our hearts to follow the King of a new Kingdom. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who comes to earth himself. And may you see Jesus as the coming King who provides entrance into his new Kingdom."

Jesus is rejected both by the Pharisees and those closest to him.

We’re told Judas, one of the 12, will betray him (Mark 3:19). Jesus’ own family thinks he has gone insane (Mark 3:21). The religious authorities slander Jesus. Though they have seen his miracles and heard him preach, they don’t believe. Instead, they accuse Jesus of being empowered by demons (Mark 3:22).

Ironically, so far in Mark, it’s only the demons who correctly identify Jesus

 

(Mark 1:24)! 

But Jesus isn't in league with the devil; instead, he’s handcuffing Satan and plundering his house (Mark 3:27). Jesus accuses the Pharisees of blaspheming the Holy Spirit. Their consistent, persistent, and willful hatred of Jesus has led them to see the work of the Spirit and call it the work of Satan. The Pharisees have hardened their hearts to Jesus.

The ministry of Jesus has been marked by people who have opposed or misunderstood him. Jesus offers his disciples a series of parables to explain why this should be expected. Like the tiny mustard seed that gives no clue to how large it can grow. Jesus’ ministry, even though hidden and persecuted now, will soon produce an unimaginable harvest.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah and says that his parables intentionally hide his message from outsiders (Mark 4:12). But Jesus knows that this hiddenness will reveal him more clearly. In fact, the only time Mark shows us a person seeing Jesus clearly is when a centurion watches him die (Mark 15:39). Like a mustard seed being buried, Jesus’s death promises new life is about to burst from the ground and the kingdom of God will no longer be hidden.

Jesus says to his disciples, “You have been given the secret of the Kingdom of God” (Mark 4:11). While the Pharisees slowly hardened their hearts to the message of Jesus, the disciples were gifted understanding. Jesus gave them the ability to see through opposition to the hidden truth in the message of the Kingdom. Life comes through death. 

This should give us hope as we face our own opposition. Jesus will bring life from our hidden sufferings. This is what the undeserving Roman centurion saw. Even though Jesus died under the weight of suffering, misunderstanding and slander he was preparing for us a weight of glory we cannot imagine (Romans 8:13). Anyone who says with the centurion “This is the Son of God,” anyone who accepts the hidden message of Jesus, will be liberated from their bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God (Romans 8:21).

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who is hidden. And may you see Jesus as the one who opens our eyes and softens our hearts to see him as our Savior."

Until this point in Mark, Jesus’ identity has remained hidden. But Peter, when asked, says to Jesus “You are the Messiah” (Mark 8:29). 

“Messiah” means “anointed one.” In the Old Testament, kings would be anointed at their coronation. It was a sign that they had been set apart by God to lead.

 

Jesus explains that his coronation will include dying and after three days rising from the dead (Mark 8:31). Anyone who wants to follow him, he warns, must die too (Mark 8:34). Jesus repeats this message three times referring to himself as the “Son of Man.” 

After this, Jesus takes Peter, James and John to a mountain where he is glorified in front of them and joined by Moses and Elijah (Mark 9:3). God booms from heaven “This is my beloved Son” (Mark 9:7). 

As they come down the mountain, the disciples still don’t understand why the “Son of Man” needs to suffer (Mark 9:10). Jesus reminds them of John the Baptist. John suffered just for talking about the Son of Man. The disciples shouldn’t be surprised if the Son of Man suffers too. 

At the foot of the mountain, a crowd is waiting for Jesus. A man with a son possessed by a demon comes to Jesus because his disciples can’t cast it out (Mark 9:18). Jesus says both the father and the crowd are faithless (Mark 9:19). The father asks in desperation, “Help my unbelief!” Jesus responds by casting out the demon. When the demon leaves, the boy looks like a corpse until Jesus takes his hand and lifts him off the ground. 

Where is the Gospel?

The phrase “Son of Man” comes from a vision in the book of Daniel where four great beasts destroy the world. From the rubble someone “like a son of man” rises up to heaven and is seated next to God (Daniel 7:13). 

An angel explains this Son of Man is a representative for all men and women trampled by the beasts. Everyone who has suffered and died under their claws will be lifted up when this representative takes his seat next to God (Daniel 7:18). Jesus is the Son of Man from Daniel. When he died and rose, he ascended to God’s throne and was coronated as king. The good news is that if we suffer and die with with him Jesus is our representative! He will certainly resurrect us and seat us in power with him. (Ephesians 2:6)

It is hard to trust that suffering and death could lead to power and life. Like the man with a possessed son, we need help in our unbelief. But Jesus said, “all things are possible for those who believe.” Jesus proves that’s true by raising the man’s son from the dead (Mark 9:23). If we believe Jesus is the Son of Man, even if it seems impossible, Jesus is willing and has the power to raise us too.

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who conquers through suffering. And may you see Jesus as the one who accepts our faith and raises us to thrones with him."

The Pharisees prided themselves in their understanding of the Scriptures. When Jesus began healing and forgiving sins, he offended them. In the next three stories, Mark shows us why—the Pharisees were offended by Jesus because they misunderstood the Scriptures. 

In the first story, the Pharisees wonder why Jesus’ disciples don’t fast (Mark 2:18). Jesus says that his ministry is like a wedding, and he is the groom. It would be inappropriate for his groomsmen to fast during a time of celebration. The Pharisees are offended because they didn’t understand that Jesus was the celebrated groom.

Next, the Pharisees accuse Jesus of breaking the Sabbath by harvesting a field for food on the day meant for rest (Mark 2:24). 

Jesus reminds them of the time when King David took the priest’s holy bread, which was permitted only for priests to eat (1 Samuel 21:6). David had the right to do what was normally prohibited because of who he was, the King of Israel. 

Finally, Jesus heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath. He says it is right to do good, even on the day of rest (Mark 3:4). Even if it means working on the Sabbath, it is better to save a life than to let someone die. 

Jesus is giving a physical example of the rest the Sabbath was supposed to provide. After all “the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27). 

And because Jesus disrupts the way the Pharisees read the Scriptures, they consider him a threat to themselves and others. From then on, the Pharisees plot to kill him (Mark 3:6). 

Where is the Gospel? 

The Pharisees loved their devotion to the law more than they loved their neighbor, which shows how they little the understood it. Jesus came to rightly interpret and fulfill Scripture for us.

In the Old Testament, God is called the groom of his bride Israel (Isaiah 54:5). His disciples didn’t fast because they were celebrating that God had come. Jesus is saying he is God the groom, in the flesh.

Jesus is also the Lord of the Sabbath. Just as David had a right to the holy bread as the king, so Jesus, as the heir of King David, can rightfully use the holy Sabbath to bring healing to a man’s hand.

At the end of Mark’s Gospel, we find Jesus, slain and laid in a tomb on the Sabbath (Mark 15:42). But after he had rested in the grave on the Sabbath, he rose, proving that he could do more than heal a man’s hand but provide true Sabbath rest for all who believe in him.

So we are to stay alert and be on our guard, always ready for that great day.",Website,Mark Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The disciples are amazed at the beauty of the temple, but Jesus tells them that it’s all coming down (Mark 13:2). 

This announcement shocked the disciples. The temple was God’s house and the center of Jewish life. The destruction of the temple would mean the end of the world as they knew it. So they ask Jesus when this will happen, and Jesus responds by telling them about several signs that must happen first. 

This passage can become confusing very quickly. Sometimes it sounds like Jesus is talking about imminent events, like the destruction of the temple by the Romans in A.D. 70. Other times, it sounds like Jesus talking about his second coming. Or maybe Jesus was talking about both the present and the future.

But regardless of which view is correct, Jesus’ encouragement to his disciples is the same—stay alert. Jesus repeats this message nine times in this passage.

“Watch out.” (13:5). “Do not be alarmed” (13:7). “Be on your guard” (13:9, 23, 33). And “keep watch” (13:33, 35, 37).

So regardless of whether Jesus is talking about the past or the future his answer to the disciples’ question is less about a date, but an attitude of confidence in God.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus tells us that persecution will come, and this is good news. When it seems that the battle is being lost, Jesus is preparing us for victory. When the disciples are captured and beaten, they will proclaim the good news of Jesus to kings and governors (13:9). When they are put on trial, the Holy Spirit will give them a perfect defense (13:11). When their families betray them and kill them, they will be saved (13:12). Through their faithfulness, all nations will hear the good news of Jesus.

But how do we know this for certain? How do we know that beatings and court cases and death is good news? How do we know that the Holy Spirit will give us words or that our suffering will end in our salvation? And the answer is—because Jesus did it first.

Jesus was beaten and whipped by the Romans. He was falsely tried by the Jews. He was betrayed by Judas. He was hated by all his own people who chanted, “Crucify him!” Jesus endured all this to the end and then rose from the dead. 

Jesus guarantees the promise by living and fulfilling it himself. All authority is given to Jesus, and this enables his disciples to confidently face suffering and sacrifice. The consequence of our persecution and judgment is resurrection power, the proclamation of the gospel to all nations, and salvation for all who endure to the end.

Jesus heals a man with an unclean spirit in the synagogue. Just before casting it out, the spirit declares that Jesus is the Holy One of God (Mark 1:24). The people were amazed at Jesus’ authority. The whole town came out to Jesus looking for their own healings (Mark 1:33-34).

A leper is among them. According to social and religious law, the leper was supposed to stay outside the city and avoid human contact. But Jesus reaches out and touches this man, and immediately the man is healed. The new flood of attention forces Jesus out of the city and into a “lonely place” (Mark 1:45).

When Jesus returns home to Capernaumn not only does he heal a paralyzed man, but he forgives his sins as well (Mark 2:5). The religious leaders condemn this as blasphemy, but the crowds glorify God (Mark 2:12). 

After this, Jesus calls Levi, a tax collector, to be his next disciple. Tax collectors were considered sinners and traitors. The religious leaders demand an explanation for why Jesus is associating with this outcast (Mark 2:16). 

Jesus explains it simply—people who claim to be well don’t need a doctor. Jesus didn’t come to call the “righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17).  

Where is the Gospel?

The leper, the paralytic, and the tax collector had one thing in common—they were all outcasts. And the good news is that Jesus saves them all by trading places with them. 

When the leper is healed, he is permitted to return to the temple, while Jesus is forced out into a “lonely place” outside the city where lepers belonged. 

The paralytic, like all people, was a sinner and Levi the tax collector was viewed as a Jewish traitor and pawn of the Roman authorities. The Pharisees refused to eat with sinners because, in their mind, breaking bread with them was a sign of being counted as one of them. 

But Jesus was not afraid to be counted among the sinners. Like Isaiah prophesied, God’s suffering servant would be numbered among the transgressors and even die like one of them (Isaiah 53:12). This is how Jesus heals the sick, accepts the outcast, and forgives the sinner—not only by going to them but by taking their place. 

He took our sickness (Isaiah 53:4). He was outcast (Hebrews 13:12). He became sin for us (2 Corinthians 5:21). Through Jesus death and resurrection, we are healed, brought near, and made righteous in him.

Jesus’ disciples are concerned about their status in his Kingdom (Mark 9:33-34). They tell Jesus they want to sit at his right hand (Mark 10:37). And moments before the disciples dismiss children as people unworthy of Jesus’ attention (Mark 10:13). 

But Jesus explains that we become great by serving the neediest and lowliest and by becoming like children (Mark 10:15). 

Almost immediately someone who is already great, a rich young man, approaches Jesus and asks what it takes to get eternal life (Mark 10:17). Jesus tells him he must become like a servant by selling everything he has and giving it to the poor” (Mark 10:21). 

Overwhelmed by the cost, the young man walks away sorrowful and disheartened at the thought of giving up all he has (Mark 10:22). 

Jesus says that entering God’s Kingdom by serving everyone or giving up everything is humanly impossible. If we are saved, it’s only because God makes it possible.

Soon after a poor and blind man named Bartimaeus asks for healing and Jesus gives it to him (10:52). These two men prove the point Jesus has been making to his disciples. It’s not the great who enter the Kingdom of God, but the least.

Jesus also wants his disciples to know that following him is costly. It will require both the death of themselves and the things they consider precious. Becoming great in the eyes of Jesus means losing everything in the eyes of this world.

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus is the ultimate picture of the greatest becoming like the lowest. Jesus came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many (Mark 10:45). Unlike the rich young man, Jesus gave up all that he had for people who didn’t deserve it. 

Like a child, Jesus obeys his Father’s plan and serves his disciples all the way to death (Luke 22:42). 

But it was precisely through Jesus’ death, and by becoming like a child dead he rose from the grave and now sits at God’s right hand. Jesus, the last, has become the first. And the good news is that when we follow Jesus’ path into becoming the least, we will be made great in him.

Jesus and his disciples are sailing when a storm arises. Frightened, the disciples find Jesus asleep below deck and wake him. Jesus stands up and rebukes the storm in the same way that he rebuked the demons. In awe, Jesus’ disciples ask, “Who then is this, that even the winds and sea obey him?” (Mark 4:41). 

When they land, Jesus and his disciples encounter another kind of storm—a man possessed by close to 2000 demons. No person or chain could restrain him (Mark 5:4). But like all the other demons in the story so far, they bow before Jesus (Mark 5:6). What no chain or man could restrain, Jesus subdue with seven words. 

Back on the other side of the lake, Jesus meets two opposite people: Jairus, a ruler of the local synagogue (Mark 5:22) and an unnamed, unclean, and shame-filled woman (Mark 5:25). 

We might expect Jesus to interact differently with these two people, but both of them are told that one thing matters—their faith. In response to the woman’s faith and Jarius’ belief, Jesus answers their prayers.

Where is the Gospel? 

This is not the first Bible story where a panicked crew goes below deck to find a man of God sleeping. Mark wants us to remember Jonah—a man who threw himself into the sea in order for the storm to stop (Jonah 1:15). Jonah offered his life as a sacrifice, but Jesus calms the storm with just a word. Jesus is greater than Jonah. And just like Jonah sacrificed his life for a storm to stop, Jesus will sacrifice his life for sin, sickness, and demons to stop. 

Jesus throws himself into the storm and spends three days in the grave, just like Jonah spent three days in the fish. Just like Jonah was spit out of the fish and declared rescue to wicked Ninevah. Jesus rises from his grave and declares over everyone whether sick, sinful or demonized what he declares over the storm -  “Peace. Be still” (Mark 4:39).

In his resurrection, Jesus shows us his power over the spiritual forces of evil (Colossians 2:15). 

If Jesus has authority over the grave, legions of demons, chronic illness and storms, he can speak life and freedom into you, too. The way you get that peace and power is through faith. Jairus and the unnamed woman were both healed the same way—by trusting in Jesus (Mark 5:34). And that is the same good news offered to you.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has power over demons and death. And may you see Jesus as the one who brings God’s merciful power to earth."

Jesus is anointed in Bethany (Mark 14:3). In the Old Testament, anointing was a sign of consecration before a prophet, priest, or king would begin their service (1 Sam 16:12). But right before and after this story, Mark tells us that the Pharisees plot to kill Jesus and Judas agrees to betray him. Jesus isn’t about to begin his ministry—he’s about to end it.

This drama builds as Jesus gathers his disciples to share Passover (Mark 14:16-17). This symbolic meal remembered how God saved Israel from Egypt and spared their families from death by the blood of a sacrificed lamb. For centuries, Jews had observed this meal and remembered that first salvation. But Jesus takes the bread and the wine and says that the feast is about him (Mark 14:22).

Jesus knows he’s about to die. He goes to a garden with his disciples and prays, feeling the crushing burden of what’s to come (Mark 14:34). He returns from his prayers to find the disciples asleep, and Judas arrives with a mob of soldiers. In this crucial moment, his disciples flee. Even Peter follows at a distance but then denies knowing Jesus three times. Jesus is left alone (Mark 14:50).

Jesus is condemned as guilty and deserving of death, even though the Jewish court cannot find a fair charge against him. Finally, they ask him directly if he is the Christ. Jesus responds by saying “I am,” and calling himself the “Son of Man” (Mark 14:62). 

In a blind rage, the priests accuse Jesus of blasphemy and tell Pilate to execute him for claiming to be the King of the Jews (Mark 14:63). Pilate leaves the decision to the crowd, who begin shouting “Crucify him!” Jesus is handed over, dressed as a mock king, beaten, spit upon, and hung on a cross.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus was anointed just before the crowning of his ministry—his death. But his coronation was a sham: his crown was made of thorns, his robe was mock reverence, and his throne was a cross. Nevertheless, Jesus was the King, the Son of Man, the I AM, and the Passover lamb

 

whose blood delivers us from eternal death and frees us from the power of sin.

Before his death, Jesus is left alone and abandoned. And this is good news, too. Jesus knows what it’s like to feel isolated and betrayed. When Jesus goes to the cross he proves he never leave or forsake those who trust in him (Hebrews 13:5). 

And when Jesus said, “I am… the Son of Man.” He proved he has the authority and power to save us from death and sin. The title “Son of Man” comes from Daniel, where a human is killed only to rise up and sit next to God to rule and judge (Daniel 7:13). Jesus is the Son of Man from Daniel. And he has all power and authority to comfort those who are suffering and save sinners from death.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who frees us from our slavery to sin. And may you see Jesus as the one who covers our guilt with his blood and declares us innocent."

It seems like the Kingdom might finally be arriving. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on an unbroken colt. The crowds gather and shout “Hosanna!” which means, “Save us, we pray!” They lay their cloaks in front of him in deep respect. They are hailing Jesus as King and Messiah (Zechariah 9:9; 2 Kings 9:13).

The next day, Jesus visits the temple and stops by a fig tree on his way in and out (Mark 11:13). The fig tree doesn’t have any fruit. Fruitlessness had long been a metaphor in the Old Testament for Israel’s disbelief and disobedience, especially among their leaders (Jeremiah 8:13; Hosea 9:16). 

Jesus enters the temple and begins driving out the merchants and money traders (Mark 11:15). The temple was supposed to be a house of prayer where Israel looked to God. But the religious leaders had turned from trusting God to trusting their own profit. As Jesus leaves, the fig tree he cursed earlier has withered and died (Mark 11:20). Just like in the Old Testament, it’s a metaphor. Israel’s leaders are unfruitful corrupt, and they about to be judged.

The religious leaders are furious with Jesus. They pepper Jesus with questions and demand to know why he believes he has the authority to do any of this (Mark 11:28). Jesus does not answer directly but asks a question to them about the identity of the Messiah from Psalm 110 (Mark 12:37). The religious cannot answer because the answer to Jesus’ question would prove his authority. 

Where is the Gospel?

Unlike the priests who sold sacrifices at criminal prices, Jesus is a better priest who offers himself as a sacrifice for free (Isa 55:1). Jesus by turning over the tables sets himself up as a new temple. That’s why, at his death, the large curtain that separated the holy from the common was torn from top to bottom (Mark 15:38). Jesus is a better Priest, the true Temple and the one sacrifice we need.

And Jesus has the authority to do this because he is not merely a son of David, but a son of God (Mark 11:10). 

This is why Jesus asked the Pharisees a question from Psalm 110:1 (Psalm 110:1). They believed the Messiah would be David’s son, but David calls the Messiah “Lord” - a title reserved for superiors, elders, and God. Jesus is hinting that the only reason a king and a father would call his son “Lord” is if that son was actually God. 

Jesus is the True King of Israel. And as both the son of David and the son of God has the authority to judge the wicked and grant salvation to anyone who calls on his name.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who makes a way for us to be finally and forever free of sin. And may you see Jesus as the sacrificial Son of David who rules forever."

At his mother’s insistence, Jesus performs his first miracle. He saves a wedding from running out of wine. But this miracle points beyond itself, John calls it a sign, to something else - the greatness and glory of Jesus (John 2:11).

When Jesus’ mother first asks him to act, he seems hesitant. He says: “My hour has not yet come” (John 2:4). But later he then instructs several servants to fill six jars used for Jewish purification rites with water (John 2:6-7). But when the water is poured into the wedding guest’s cups, it becomes the best tasting wine of the wedding (John 2:10).

Shortly after this, Jesus shows up at the temple and drives out all those buying and selling animals (John 2:15). He accuses those in the temple of turning God’s house into a house of trade (John 2:16). Jesus’ anger at these common temple practices assumes authority to prescribe what should and shouldn’t happen in the temple. The religious leaders demand Jesus prove that authority with a sign (John 2:18). Jesus replies, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (John 2:19)

Where is the Gospel?

John calls Jesus’ first miracle a sign because it points beyond itself to the kind of joy that Jesus intends to bring (John 2:11). Jesus has come to invite us to a wedding between himself and his people! But when Jesus says, “My time has not yet come,” he’s referring to his death. Jesus knows our invitation to his wedding comes at the cost of his life.

Which is why he chooses the jars for purification. Before entering the temple and into God’s presence, Jews would wash the dirt off of them from jars like these. When Jesus chooses those jars he’s revealing that it’s only through his wine and water that we’re brought into the presence of God. And that purifying wine and water is poured out on the cross when water and blood spill from Jesus' side (John 19:34). 

This is why Jesus has authority to clean the temple from it’s impure practices. Jesus is the purifier. And just like the wine being poured out is a symbol of Jesus’ death, purifying blood and  guarantee of our wedding day joy. So is the temple. The temple is where God’s presence met his people. Jesus kicks out the buyers and sellers because the payment to enter into God’s presence was about to be paid. The temple of Jesus’ body was going to be destroyed and three days later the wedding between God’s presence and his people would begin.

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who longs to invite us into his presence. And may you see Jesus as the one who purifies our hearts so we can have rest with God."

Unlike Lazarus, who eventually died again, Jesus will rise and never die.",Website,John Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

This story can be hard to hear. 

Jesus hears that his friend Lazarus is sick. But instead of rushing to his friend’s side, Jesus intentionally waits until Lazarus dies. John tells us this is because he loved Lazarus (John 11:5). And Jesus says that Lazarus’ sickness and death will glorify him and make many believe (John 11:4). But Lazarus’ family is unsure. Three different times they question Jesus’ motives. (John 11:21, 32, 37).

By the time Jesus arrives at the tomb, he’s weeping—but he knew from the beginning that he was going to raise him (John 11:3). Jesus’ tears can’t be for Lazarus.

John also tells us that Jesus is “deeply moved,” or another translation would be “furious” (John 11:33). Jesus walks up to Lazarus’ tomb, eyes red with tears and cheeks flushed in anger. 

Why? Because this miracle isn’t just about raising Lazarus from the dead, it’s about Jesus being raised from the dead too. 

Jesus knows that everyone he loves will inevitably die. He weeps and is angry that the world he created and the people he intricately formed in their mother’s wombs will never escape sin’s victory. The world he created without suffering, evil, and sickness has claimed the lives of every person. So Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead (John 11:43). 

In response to Jesus’ most important miracle, almost no one believes. John 12 describes groups of people who are confronted with Jesus’ signs but refuse to follow the signs to their conclusion (John 12:37). So hard-hearted is the disbelief of Israel that the Pharisees conspire to kill Jesus. They reason that it’s better that one person dies than a whole nation suffer under the wrath of Rome.

Where is the Gospel?

As the Pharisees plot against Jesus, they don’t realize that the Holy Spirit is working through their schemes to pave the way for God’s plan. 

Jesus would be the only person to die, but not under Rome’s wrath—under God’s just anger at sin and death. Not only would Jesus die for the people of Israel but for all people. Jesus' coming death is not a victory for the religious elite hoping to keep the status quo. Instead, it’s the enthronement of Jesus above all powers, even death.

Mary understood this. Twice we’re told that Mary breaks open her most expensive perfume and anoints Jesus’ feet for burial (John 12:3). She believed, as Jesus hoped, that Lazarus’ death and resurrection pointed toward Jesus’ death and resurrection. She understood that Jesus came to destroy death by dying himself and rising from the grave.

Nicodemus is a member of the same religious leadership that will eventually crucify Jesus, but he’s curious. He doesn’t understand how Jesus could perform miracles unless God was with him (John 3:2). 

Jesus tells Nicodemus the only way to understand him or his signs is if he is “born again” (John 3:3) 

And he tells Nicodemus, that shouldn’t surprise him. Humans must be born before they can understand the world of humans. And he must be born again if he wants to understand spiritual matters (John 3:6). He will need to be given new eyes to see, new ears to hear, and a new heart to perceive.

And there’s a second reason Nicodemus shouldn’t be surprised by the idea of being born again.This is precisely what the Old Testament taught as well. Being a part of God’s people always meant a change of heart and nature (Deuteronomy 30:6). 

If Nicodemus doesn’t understand why he needs a renewed heart, Jesus says he will never understand that God descended from heaven in Jesus to be lifted up on a cross and die to offer eternal life to those who believe in him (John 3:12).

Where is the Gospel?

In the book of Numbers an unspiritual and miracle-dismissing Israel are punished with a plague of poisonous snakes (Numbers 21:6). God tells Moses to make a bronze serpent and lift it up so that anyone who looks to it will be saved (Numbers 21:8). Nicodemus should know that all humanity has a God-denying poison in their veins. He should expect that, just as God offered a way to save Israel from physical poison, there would be a day when salvation would be made flesh and lifted up again, so that God’s people could be born again (John 3:14-15). 

After all, God doesn’t hate the world; he loves it (John 3:16). But the world stands condemned, poisoned and on the verge of death (John 3:18). Jesus comes to rescue all of us, who like Nicodemus are writhing in our unbelief. He became flesh so that he would be lifted up on the cross and save all those who look to him.

Jesus hosts a last meal with his disciples. He knows he’s about to die, and he knows he is about to return to his Father. And knowing both those things, Jesus takes off his shirt, kneels in the dirt, and washes his disciples’ feet (John 13:3-5). Peter is offended that his Master would stoop so low. But Jesus explains that this is a symbol of salvation—if Peter refuses Jesus’ humiliation, he will never share Jesus’ eternal life (John 13:8). 

Taking the logic one step further, Peter demands Jesus wash all of him (John 13:9). But Jesus makes a second point—Peter is already clean; all he needs are his feet washed. Once Jesus saves him and makes him pure before God, he cannot lose that because nothing is more powerful than the stain-washing power of Jesus' blood (John 13:10). But as Peter takes up the messy task of following Jesus, he will find that acting like Jesus will always require additional washing. Jesus' humiliation saves them definitely and continually. 

But just because Jesus washed his disciples feet and they had proximity to him doesn’t guarantee that everyone is with him. Jesus makes it clear to Peter that Judas is a traitor and sends Judas out of the house (John 13:26). With Judas gone, Jesus' death is fast approaching. Jesus begins to share final words with his followers.

In Jesus’ humiliation, God will be worshipped. His glory will be proclaimed as Jesus rises from the dead. So although the disciples cannot join Jesus on that journey, they can continue his ministry in his place. They can love one another just as he has loved them (John 13:34-35). And when they copy Jesus’ humiliating, sacrificial love toward one another, the world will witness the power of the gospel. 

Where is the Gospel?

We live in a world that is indifferent or hostile to Jesus. But Christians are supposed to prefer the humiliation of service and death over the honor of being served. Jesus washed Judas’ feet. He fed him from his hand. Christian’s should have this same posture of humble sacrifice toward the world. We offer Christ-like love, knowing that not all will respond with devotion to Christ. But in doing so, our lives become good news. 

Our lives become a living continuation of what Jesus said in John 3:16. Just as God so loved the world that he sent Jesus, Jesus so loves the world that he sends us. We aren’t sent to condemn the world but to wash its feet and use our few and final hours to prepare a feast for it. 

We’re promised that when we love others as Christ has loved us, the world will know that we are Jesus’ disciples. Jesus’ foot washing is not just an example for us to follow but a guarantee that a Christian’s humiliation is never wasted. In Christ, death and humiliation is always the path to eternal life and honor.

After a long ministry that foreshadowed what Jesus would have to do to rescue his people, Jesus’ time finally comes. A mob arrests Jesus and brings him to be tried and sentenced by the High Priest and Pilate the Roman governor. 

At his arrest, trial, and sentencing, Jesus proves he is far more than people expect. He’s more than a revolutionary; he’s the true King. He’s more than a rogue preacher; he’s the one proclaiming the coming of the Kingdom of Truth. He’s not simply “Jesus of Nazareth;” he is God himself, the great I AM.

A mob of soldiers confronts Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane and asks if he is Jesus. He responds with a phrase John has used six times in his Gospel account, “I am.” John tells us that the weight of those words, uttered a seventh time by the one who made the world in seven days, causes the mob to fall down before the Creator (John 18:5-6). Jesus, God himself, carries all authority, and he is about to lay it all down to save sinful people. 

Jesus arrives at the High Priest’s home to be interrogated (John 18:12-13). Almost immediately, Peter denies he’s ever met Jesus (John 18:17). But while Peter lies, Jesus tells the truth. He doesn’t back down from anything he said during his ministry and even challenges the High Priest to produce witnesses (John 18:21). Determined to kill him, the Jews take Jesus to Pilate’s for sentencing (John 18:28). Jesus is condemned to death for claiming the truth about his identity while Peter denies even knowing Jesus twice more. 

Pilate isn’t stupid. He knows the Sanhedrin has an angle. The Jews frame Jesus as a threat to Roman power, which is odd. Jews don’t normally help Rome get rid of its problems. So Pilate asks Jesus: “Are you the King of the Jews?” and “What have you done?” (John 18:33)

Jesus explains that he is the King of Truth, and his truth sets people free (John 18:37). Pilate rejects that there is any truth other than power and political expediency (John 18:38). His point is proven when he offers the Jews a choice between freeing Barrabas, a known threat to Rome, and Jesus, whose kingdom is not of this world. If the Jews are really concerned about Rome, they’ll free Jesus. But if it’s all about politics and power, they’ll free Barabbas. They show their hand and choose Barabbas (John 18:40).

Both the Jews and Pilate choose power over the truth that Jesus is King. For now, power trumps truth.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus’ arrest, trial and sentencing are good news because they show us a Savior who does not swerve at oncoming traffic. Jesus is single minded. He will save. He will protect his people. 

When confronted in the garden, Jesus could have run and allowed his disciples to get arrested. But instead, he tells the soldiers to let his disciples go (John 18:8). He provides their physical safety but also begins the process of keeping them eternally safe from principalities and powers. Jesus could have lied like Peter and escaped his trial. But he bears witness to the truth that he alone saves, even though that truth will cost his life. And all of this will happen because, as Jesus said to Nicodemus, “the Son of Man must be lifted up” on a cross (John 3:14).

Jesus demonstrates through his arrest, trial, and sentence that believing the truth of eternal life is worth any suffering. But Jesus doesn't just believe this truth; he died to make it reality. Jesus did not flinch under the weight of false accusation. He stood as the King of Truth and gave up his life so that those who look to him will have everlasting life. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit give you eyes to see the God who is Truth. And may you see Jesus who lived to bear witness to the truth so that we might know the truth that sets us free."

Throughout his Gospel account, John has shown that Jesus’ kingdom is inseparable from his suffering. The water Jesus turned into wine was poured from ceremonial cleansing jars, just as Jesus’s blood and water are poured to cleanse us from our sin. Jesus heals a paralytic and lame man on the Sabbath to demonstrate he is King of the Sabbath. Jesus provides bread and fish in the desert to signal he is the new King of Israel. And Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead to show that his Kingdom would battle death and win. 

John also goes to great lengths to prove that Jesus' kingship and suffering are necessary conclusions to all of Scripture. John quotes from Exodus, Numbers, Zechariah, and multiple Psalms. Jesus’ death is the climax, not just of John’s story, but Israel’s. And this is most clear because Jesus’ death takes place at Passover. Just as the Old Testament climaxed with God passing over Israel by the blood of a lamb, so Jesus is “the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world,” and he will cause God to pass over again (John 1:29). 

So Pilate flogs Jesus (John 19:1). The soldiers abuse him and force a crown of thorns on his head and a purple robe on his shoulders (John 19:2). Pilate displays a ridiculed Jesus to the crowds. Like a lamb before its butcher, this King is battered, bloody, and firmly under Roman control (John 19:4). 

But Pilate was never in control (John 19:11). While Pilate declares to the crowd, “Behold the man!” he says more than he realizes. Jesus really is the Man. He is the Word made flesh (John 1:14). And in response to God’s revelation, the crowds demand that Jesus’ blood be spread on the cross beams of a crucifix in the same way the lamb’s blood covered their doors at home. 

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus’ arrest and trial are good news because they show us that Jesus never swerves from his mission to save his people. The torture and crucifixion of Jesus are good news because the same act Rome intends to crush Jesus is the very act God intends to coronate him. The crown of thorns was a true crown. The purple robe was a true symbol of his majesty. And his cross was actually his throne. What Rome meant for evil, God meant for good. 

In his death Jesus was crowned as the new Lamb, able to save the people from their sins. In his crucifixion he is crowned as the King over death. And in his suffering he is crowned the Lord of the Sabbath. 

This is good news because if God can use betrayal, torture, cowardice, and murder to crown his Son, then he can take our suffering and our sin and nail it to the cros, too. We assume our suffering is proof of God’s distance and dispassion, but in Christ we see that suffering is how we are exalted like Jesus. We assume our sin disqualifies us from God’s presence, but our sin is precisely why Jesus came to die. 

Jesus' death is good news because there is no suffering that God cannot redeem, and there is no sin that can stop God’s love for you in Christ. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who takes what we intend for evil and intends it for good. And may you see Jesus as not just an example of this truth but a promise that God will most certainly do for you what he has already done for his Son."

His life and Spirit are better water than God provided in the wilderness.",Website,John Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

After feeding the 5000, some of Jesus’ followers want him to leave Galilee and go to Jerusalem for the Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles—a week-long celebration of God’s provision for Israel in the wilderness (John 7:3). 

When they encourage him to go, Jesus responds by saying, “My time has not yet come,” the same phrase he used in John 2 at the wedding in Cana (John 7:6). Yet just like Cana, Jesus seems to contradict his words when he goes to Jerusalem a few days later. 

Multiple times, John quotes Jesus saying “my time” to refer not to the present but to his coming death. At this moment, the threat is imminent. The crowds murmur about Jesus (John 7:13). He announces that some in the crowd are seeking to kill him (John 7:19), and the Pharisees send Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus for stirring up the crowd (John 7:33). Jesus knows “my time has not yet come,” but his coming death is imminent.  

Jesus breaks the categories held by the religious leaders and citizens of Jerusalem. The religious leaders can’t understand why Jesus is so authoritative (John 7:15), and the people can’t understand how the Christ could be from Nazareth (John 7:27, 41,52). Yet who could do more than what Jesus has done (John 7:31)? The whole city wants to know, “Who is Jesus?”

Where is the Gospel?

On the last day of the Feast, the High Priest would leave the temple with a giant golden flagon, parade through the city to the Pool of Siloam, fill the flagon with water, and return to the temple. This ritual celebrated God’s gift of water in the desert for wandering Israel. 

People would sing Psalms 113-118 as the parade took place, and as it ended the priest would pour out the water and some wine as offerings to the Lord (Leviticus 23:27). This is the moment Jesus stands up and interrupts. 

Jesus says that the water and the wine being poured out are about him. More than this, he claims that anyone who is thirsty should drink from him. Jesus is claiming to possess the faithfulness of God to satisfy humanity’s deepest needs. But instead of water from a flagon at a feast, Jesus will pour out his own blood from his body on the cross. Jesus is promising that when water and blood flow from his side, anyone who trusts his wounds will see God’s faithfulness again. 

Jesus promises that those who drink of this stream will themselves overflow through the Spirit (John 7:38). The river of blood and water from Jesus’ side gives us life. And as our lives are filled up with his life, we too will bleed out the compassion and life of Jesus to the world around us. Just as God met the needs of Israel in the wilderness, so Jesus meets our needs and fills us with his Spirit so that we can meet the needs of others.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is faithful to meet our needs. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives us life eternal, abundant enough to overflow into the lives of others."

He himself doesn't just provide bread for hungry bellies in the wilderness; he is the Bread of Life that grants eternal fullness to all who eat his body.",Website,John Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

The people want Jesus for his signs but not what they signify (John 6:2, 26). They want Jesus to give them bread, but they do not want to eat his flesh. They want Jesus’ miracles, but they’re not ready for Jesus as Messiah. Some of their last words to Jesus are, “Who can listen to you” (John 6:60)? 

In this chapter, Jesus performs some of his greatest miracles—walking on water and feeding a multitude. Yet it’s easy to miss just how few people see what these miracles mean. Jesus has not come to fill their bellies with fish; he has come to fill them with himself. He hasn't come to bring manna that only delays hunger and delays death (John 6:58); he’s come to satisfy hunger and destroy death. 

The crowds keep seeing in Jesus another Moses, and they’re half right. Jesus is like Moses. He provided bread in the wilderness. He fed the twelve tribes of Israel (with 12 baskets of leftovers). But they’re also half wrong. Moses never did those things—God did. (John 6:32). 

Jesus wants the crowds to know that the bread that saves them is not an “it” but a “he.” “For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world” (John 6:33). Jesus’ point is subtle but clear—he is one and the same with God who made manna fall from heaven and parted the Red Sea. But the crowd is not ready for this truth, so their last words to Jesus are, “Who can listen to this?”

Only the disciples say otherwise. While everyone saw what Jesus did, only the disciples saw who Jesus was—God himself. The point of this miracle was for the crowds to understand that “everyone who looks to [Jesus] and believes in him should have eternal life” (John 6:40). But only the disciples get the message.

And perhaps this is because Jesus walked on water only in front of them. When King David described the parting of the Red Sea, he said that God’s “way was through the Sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen” (Psalm 77:19). The first time we see God’s footprints is when Jesus chooses to reveal them to his disciples.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus is still revealing himself today. He is still drawing new disciples, he is still granting eternal life. This may not be only through miracles, but it is most certainly through the eyewitness account you are about to read. 

Jesus declares to a crowd of people and to anyone who reads the account of it, that he completes the loose ends from the Old Testament. He is the Bread of Life that doesn’t leave you hungry. And any who eat him, who see him, who believe in him will have eternal life. They will be raised up from the dead just like he will  be.

Jesus shares a last meal with his disciples. He has prepared them for his departure with the promise of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit will fill them and empower them to continue Jesus’ ministry. We hear in John 17 Jesus’ prayer over us. It is an intimate look at how God thinks of his mission and our role in continuing what Jesus started. 

What’s striking in this moment is that Jesus claims to have never acted alone. Over and over, Jesus reminds God of what he had given him. In fact, Jesus says he received everything from God (John 17:6). His authority, his eternal life, his words, and even his disciples were all gifts from God (John 17:2, 6, 8). Often we think of Jesus as a lone actor on God’s behalf. But Jesus says his every word and action was entirely dependent on the Father and Spirit. Jesus’ ministry was successful because he was one with them.

But the disciples are scared. How can they endure coming hardship without Jesus, this perfect unity of heaven and earth? What Jesus prays for them is stunning. He prays that they would be one with God and the Holy Spirit in the same way he is (John 17:22-23). Jesus prays as if his disciples are indistinguishable from himself. The disciples don’t need God to save them from the world—they need him to make them Jesus in the world.

Jesus places on his followers the same mantle that was placed on him. Just as he is “not of this world,” so he declares that his disciples are separate from the world, too (John 17:16). Just as Jesus was filled and propelled by the Holy Spirit to do his work, so the disciples will be filled and propelled by the same Spirit to continue that work. Just as God sent Jesus into the world, so now Jesus sends his disciples into the world. (John 17:18).

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus’ told his disciples that it was better that he left so that the Holy Spirit would come. John 17 tells us why. When Jesus dies, he takes the oneness he had with God and the Spirit and gives it to all who depend on him. 

If we depend on God for everything, we will be one with him. If we depend on God for our authority and our wisdom about right and wrong, we will be  one with the creator of everyone and everything. If we depend on God for our life, the Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead unites us with the Author of eternal life. If we depend on God for our words, the Word made flesh becomes one with our flesh, and we join him in his redemption of the world, healing the sick, and making famous the God who lived, died and rose again.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is one Jesus and all who believe in him. And may you Jesus as the one who makes all this possible through his life, death, and resurrection and prays you would know it to be true."

Jesus confronts the religious leaders about the nature of his life and authority. After healing a man who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years, the religious leaders demand an explanation for why he performed a miracle on the Sabbath (John 5:16).

Jesus responds by saying he was only following the example of his Father, who is always working (John 5:17). Jesus is entirely dependent on God and perfectly in sync with the desires and actions of his heavenly Father (John 5:19). 

And Jesus tells the Pharisees that he is able to do far more than heal a paralyzed man. God can give life to dead people, and Jesus says this same power has been given to him (John 5:21). If they believe in his words they too will pass from death to life. And that’s because Jesus says he has “life in himself” (John 5:26). He has authority to either resurrect or withhold his life. 

The Pharisees demand proof of this authority and Jesus gives three witnesses: John the Baptist, God, and Moses (John 5:32). John was Jesus’ most outspoken advocate during his ministry. God declared Jesus’ identity at his baptism. And Jesus tells the religious leaders that Moses pointed to him through the Torah. The religious leaders have every reason to believe in the Son of God.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus has the power to give life to whoever he chooses, and that authority will be confirmed when he lays down his own life and rises from the dead (John 5:27).

Jesus rebukes the religious leaders for not seeing this in the Old Testament (John 5:46-47). His death is the reason for his coming and the reason that God has given him authority. Jesus is God’s chosen judge, who gives life through his death. 

And in the same way that life would come from death, Jesus promises that the dead will come to life (John 5:25). He promises those who are in their graves will rise to live (John 5:28-29). Not by their willpower but by believing and recognizing Jesus’ authority to judge and grant life. Everyone who calls on Jesus’ name will cross over from death to life. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who gives all authority to his Son. And may you see Jesus as the perfect one who grants anyone who believe in him with eternal life."

The Gospel of John opens with the words, “In the beginning” (John 1:1). These words should remind us of Genesis, where God created the world with his words (Genesis 1:1). John tells us that God’s words are so powerful, so concrete, that they’re more than sounds; God’s Word is a person. 

This Word was with God and is God. Just as God spoke light into darkness, God speaks Light into a dark world again, his name is Jesus (John 1:5). And though we expect God’s Light and Word to be obvious when he appears, most people neither see the Light nor hear God’s voice.

So God sends a man named John to prepare his people to understand that Jesus is the word made flesh. John was humble, never drawing attention to himself (John 1:20). Instead he defined his ministry with the words of Isaiah 40:3, “I’m the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord’” (John 1:23). 

John was known for his practice of baptizing people as a sign of repentance and renewal. He understood this prophetic practice only pointed towards a greater renewal that would be brought by Jesus (John 1:33). John’s baptism was a symbol of internal cleansing, but Jesus would bring true renewal opening eyes to his light and ears to his word.

And when John finally sees Jesus he declares that he is the Lamb of God (John 1:29). It was his way of saying that Jesus would remove the darkness of our sin and give us the light of life by his sacrificial death. While the world was blind to what was happening in front of them, John saw and testified that Jesus was the Son of God (John 1:34).

Where is the Gospel?

One of the most shocking claims of Christianity is that God becomes human. While some gods in ancient mythologies take the form of a human, Jesus is God’s very words and very life himself. Some see this as blasphemous while others find it confusing—how can someone be fully human and fully God?

But John the Baptist recognized what no one else saw. When light and life become flesh and bone we have real hope for freedom from the dominion of darkness and silence of death. 

That’s because light cannot be sacrificed. Words alone cannot take away the painful consequences of our sins. The only way our sins can be removed is if the Word can bleed, if the Light can be cut, and if the Life can die. And God, saw a world under threat of darkness and death sent himself to die like the Passover Lamb, and secure light and life for all people. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes to see the God who creates all things by his powerful Word. And may you see Jesus as the creating Word who became flesh to be the lamb of God for us. "

In fact, the Holy Spirit in us is better than Jesus continuing to live alongside us.",Website,John Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

Jesus has just told his disciples he is about to die. And with his last words, Jesus comforts them with the promise of the Holy Spirit and warns them of coming persecution (John 14:16,15:20). 

The disciples don’t understand. They want to follow Jesus and know where he is going. Jesus responds by telling them that he goes to prepare a place for them with his Father (John 14:2). Jesus is on a mission to reunite us with God. When Philip asks to see the Father, Jesus tells him that to see Jesus is to see the Father. Jesus is the perfect representation of God (John 14:9).

Jesus gives them a promise. Once he leaves, another Helper will come who will help them see and know the Father—the Holy Spirit (John 14:26). This Spirit will fill them as Jesus was filled, enabling us to live out the character and nature of God on earth. Through the Holy Spirit, we are reminded of Jesus’ teachings and empowered to keep God’s commands, reflect his wisdom, and perform the same works as Jesus. The one who lived inside Jesus will now live inside us.

Jesus compares it to a vineyard and the fruit it produces. God is the gardener, Jesus is the vine, and the disciples are the branches (John 15:1-2). As they hold fast to Jesus, the life of the vine will fill them and overflow in nourishing fruit. The work of Jesus will be the natural outflow of the life of Jesus in them (John 15:4).

But this good news comes at a cost. Jesus lived his life perfectly hearing and obeying God, and it will lead to his death. Jesus promises that if his disciples follow his course of life, they too will be hated by the world (John 15:18). A servant isn’t greater than their master, and this Master willingly lays down his life.

Where is the Gospel?

The disciples are about to lose their flesh-and-bones Messiah. They’re about to experience intense persecution and torture. And for thousands of years since, you and I have had to live without the presence of Jesus. But the good news for us today is this: That it is to our advantage that Jesus left so we could be filled with the Spirit (John 16:7). Jesus promises that the Spirit in us is even better than the Son beside us.

Jesus perfectly reflected God’s image, yet he could only be in one place at a time. But now the same Spirit that animated the life of Jesus lives in all of his followers, enabling and equipping them to live like Jesus (John 14:12).

The Holy Spirit doesn’t just empower our actions; he empowers our message. Jesus says that the Spirit convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). Through the death of Jesus and the gift of the Spirit, our disbelief dies, and we are raised with Jesus to rule over all the powers of this world. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who filled the Son with his Spirit. And may you see Jesus as the one who empowers us to face suffering and live boldly by the power of that same Spirit in us."

Jesus shows us that the spiritual sight needed to accept his claims is a gift he gives freely to those humble enough to admit they cannot see.",Website,John Bible Study,"What’s Happening?

John 8-10 includes some of the most intense dialogue in the Gospels. Jesus calls the Pharisees “sons of Satan” who “kill, steal and destroy.” In return, they accuse Jesus twice of being possessed by a demon, bring up his mother’s questionable pregnancy, wonder if he will commit suicide, and try to arrest him. What sparks these fiery accusations? Jesus’ claims about himself.

Jesus claimed to be the “light of the world” and promises that those who follow him will have true life (8:12).

Jesus said he was “from above” and that his listeners were from “this world.” And unless his hearers believed that, they would die in their sin (8:24).

Jesus said that those who hold onto his words are his disciples who will be set free by the truth (8:31-32).

Jesus said that those who keep his word will never see death (8:51).

Jesus claimed to exist even before Abraham (8:58).

Jesus claimed to be the shepherd God promised Israel (10:14).

Jesus’ claims are met with confusion, argument, and eventually stones. Jesus says that so few people hear him because they are “not of God” (John 8:47) Like Nicodemus, this crowd needs to be reborn. God needs to draw them. God needs to open the eyes of the spiritually blind if they are going to see Jesus as the light of the world.

To drive this point home, Jesus heals a man who is physically blind. Ironically, the blind man who has never seen Jesus is the only one who sees him as the light of the world. And the Pharisees who claim to see the truth so clearly are blind to it (John 9:41). This sign is a living picture of how we are saved—not by our wisdom but by God’s power. 

Where is the Gospel?

Like the disciples, we often don’t know we are blind or enslaved (John 9:33). We assume we see better than we can and are more free than we are. But here’s the verdict of Jesus—the more we claim to see, the more we are blind. 

Religious figures and traditions throughout history have claimed to see the light, but all of them died in darkness. Even Abraham and the prophets of the Old Testament died (John 8:52-53). But Jesus, the light of the world, died only to rise like the sun. 

When Jesus’ closed his eyes in death, our eyes finally opened. Our ears finally hear the voice of the Shepherd who defeats the valley of the shadow of death. And in the arms of such a Shepherd, we can know that none can snatch us out of his hand (John 10:29).

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your blind eyes to the God who sent his Son to bear witness to the light. And may you see Jesus, the good Shepherd whose voice and light leads us on to eternal life."

The book of Acts is the sequel to the Gospel of Luke, written by the same author. Luke picks up where he left off, describing how Jesus spends 40 days with his disciples talking about the Kingdom of God (Acts 1:3). 

Remember, Israel had been a divided kingdom for centuries. They were still waiting for God to fulfill the promises he made about their kingdom. 

All this Kingdom talk prompts the disciples to ask if Israel is about to be restored as an earthly kingdom (Acts 1:6). But Jesus responds that it’s not for them to know when the Kingdom will be restored (Acts 1:7). The disciples would have to wait in Jerusalem for that restoration. 

The coming of the Holy Spirit will be that moment. Then the disciples will be transformed into Jesus’ witnesses of this new Kingdom in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria—and to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). 

This verse forms a table of contents for the entire book, tracking the spread of the Gospel. It also promises Jesus will send the Holy Spirit to make good on God’s promises to restore his Kingdom and save his people. 

That is exactly what happens in Acts chapter 2 on the day of Pentecost. Jews and converts to Judaism from every nation under heaven are in Jerusalem, and they all speak different languages (Acts 2:5). It reminds us of the Tower of Babel back in Genesis (Genesis 11:1). That’s where all nations came together to try to build their own kingdom, but were scattered across the earth with different languages (Genesis 11:9). 

Suddenly the Holy Spirit comes to the apostles and empowers them to miraculously declare the wonders of God in multiple languages at once (Acts 2:11). Peter preaches about Jesus as the true King of Israel (Acts 2:30). Jesus does not sit on an earthly throne over an earthly kingdom, but is fulfilling all the promises of the Old Testament by bringing a new Kingdom that he rules from his heavenly throne (Acts 2:33).  

When the crowds hear the good news about Jesus, who died on a cross and has risen from the dead, they know he is the promised descendent of King David who will usher in the restored Kingdom of God (Acts 2:36). And now, with the coming of the Holy Spirit in power, no one can deny that these are the last days all the prophets had spoken of (Acts 2:17). 

At this news, thousands of Jews repent, are baptized in the name of Jesus, and also receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus’ death, resurrection, and ascension sparked a revolution that is taking over all nations, governments, and all other forms of power (Acts 2:34). 

This is good news because, like Israel, we live in a divided kingdom. The kingdom of our world has set itself up as hostile against the Kingdom of God. But if we relinquish our allegiance to the kingdom of earth and pledge ourselves to King Jesus, we will join God’s Kingdom (Acts 2:21). 

Two things happen when we join the Kingdom of God: Our sins are forgiven and we receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). We become outposts for God’s Kingdom. 

Babel brought kingdoms and thrones of separation and confusion. The heavenly throne of God’s Kingdom brings union and peace. 

Our new positions in God’s Kingdom now compel us to go to the whole world and bring unity where there was division. The Kingdom of God is taking what has been fragmented and is making it one.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who is true to every promise he makes. And may you see Jesus as the final promised King who invites entry for all nations into his Kingdom."

Philip arrives in Samaria and proclaims that Jesus is the Messiah (Acts 8:5). He heals people, casts out demons, and proclaims the Gospel to the city (Acts 8:7). 

But then we meet Simon, a man who spiritually rules over the people of Samaria by impressing them with sorcery (Acts 8:9). These demonically empowered works are similar to what we might call magic. The Samaritans worship him as a god (Acts 8:10). Apparently, Samaria is Satan’s dominion. 

But when Philip proclaims the Kingdom of God, he breaks the spell over the people (Acts 8:12). Simon himself believes and is baptized (Acts 8:13). The apostles arrive from Jerusalem to pray for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:15). Amazingly, the Spirit comes on the estranged Samaritans just as the devout Jews in Jerusalem also received the Spirit (Acts 8:17). 

Simon is amazed and asks to buy this power from the apostles (Acts 8:18-19). Peter says this free gift cannot be bought with money and tells Simon to repent (Acts 8:20-23). 

Philip continues his journey by heading south through Judea where he meets an Ethiopian eunuch reading the book of Isaiah (Acts 8:27-28). Because this man is a eunuch, he is traditionally kept from full fellowship with God’s people (Deuteronomy 23:1). It’s not surprising to learn he is reading a portion of Isaiah that talks about a time when God will bring both foreigners and eunuchs into his Kingdom (Isaiah 56:3-5). 

The eunuch is reading specific verses in Isaiah that promise a servant of God who would be deprived of justice and be killed (Acts 8:33). He would be cut off, like the Ethiopian, to bring others near (Isaiah 53:4). Philip explains that this servant of God is Jesus (Acts 8:35). The eunuch believes, is baptized, and heads on toward Ethiopia as the first recipient of the Gospel “to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8; 8:39).

Where is the Gospel?

The Gospel coming to Samaria and Ethiopia is a sign that Jesus’ words at the beginning of Acts are being fulfilled (Acts 1:8). God is moving toward those who are far from him. 

Just as Samaria was under the spell of Simon’s demonic sorcery, the entire world is under the spell of Satan’s kingdom (Ephesians 2:2). We live in enemy occupied territory. But the good news is that just as the Holy Spirit overtook Simon’s territory in Samaria, Jesus has overtaken Satan’s territory in the world (1 John 5:4).  The Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus are stronger than the kingdom of the world, the flesh, and the Devil (Acts 8:12). 

God continues to conquer the works of Satan through us, by the power of his Holy Spirit—just as he did with Philip. Simon tried to buy this power, but the best news of the Gospel is that it’s free. 

The Ethiopian especially needed a free Gospel. As a eunuch, his condition made him feel cut off from the people of God. It’s not hard to imagine that his sojourn to Jerusalem for Passover was part of his effort to buy his way into feeling closer to God. 

Likewise, it’s easy to feel like we have a shortcoming, flaw, or defect that will ultimately keep us from full fellowship with God. And we try all kinds of ways to heal or resolve that feeling.  

But, as Phillip pointed out from the Ethiopian’s copy of Isaiah, Jesus takes our imperfections onto himself (Isaiah 53:4). By way of the cross, Jesus has taken on  anything that might keep us from God (Isaiah 53:6). And by his wounds, we are healed (Isaiah 53:5).  

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who moves towards those who are far from him. And may you see Jesus as the mighty Conqueror of evil who died for our sins and now rules over all. "

The book of Acts draws to a close as Paul draws closer to Rome. Acts started at the center of Jewish life, in Jerusalem during Pentecost. Now it ends at the center of Gentile life in the capital city of Rome. Jesus’ words have come full circle—the Gospel has been preached in Jerusalem, all Judea and Samaria, and has now reached the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). And as Paul moves into the center of Gentile power, the narrative doubles down on God’s heart to save the nations. 

Under Roman guard, Paul sets sail to hold trial under Caesar in Rome (Acts 27:1).The journey is difficult and tumultuous. A storm threatens all 276 passengers, but Paul receives a message from God to stay with the ship. The crew decides to trust Paul, and they run aground on the island of Malta (Acts 27:20-44).

Upon arrival, Paul is attacked by a poisonous snake but does not die. The people believe him to be a god. They treat Paul and his companions well, outfitting them with a ship that takes them to Rome (Acts 28:10). 

Once in Rome, Paul shows a large group of Jews how Jesus fulfills the Old Testament through his death and resurrection. But many of them refuse to believe (Acts 28:17, 23-24). 

This leads Paul to quote Isaiah the prophet, saying they will hear but never understand because they have closed their ears and eyes to God (Acts 28:26-27). Instead of continuing to plead with the Jews, Paul again turns his ministry toward the Gentiles who will listen (Acts 28:28). 

This is how Acts ends—with Paul preaching the Gospel of Jesus, boldly and without hindrance, to the Gentiles in Rome (Acts 28:31). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Just as the Gentiles on board the ship with Paul simply trust God’s word, seek refuge on the boat, and are saved, so Gentiles all over the world can trust in Jesus, seek refuge in him, and be saved (Acts 27:25). 

The New Testament even compares Jesus to a boat that keeps us safe from a storm. When we put our faith in Jesus, we are protected from the storms of our guilt and condemnation (1 Peter 3:21). We hide in Christ like Noah hid in the ark and like Paul and his companions hid in their boat. 

Paul’s miraculous survival from a snake bite opens an opportunity to share the Gospel to the tribes of Malta. God shows his authority above every other deity (Colossians 2:15). 

Like Paul, Jesus was stung by the most venomous snake of all. The open mouth of the grave filled his veins with the poison of death (Hebrews 2:9). Like the islanders, many thought this meant Jesus, his ministry, and his claims were discredited (Luke 24:20-21). But while death struck Jesus’ heel, he crushed its serpentine head (Genesis 3:15).

Like Paul, Jesus walked away from the grave unharmed (Luke 24:6). The locals of Malta thought Paul was a god for cheating death, but Jesus proved himself to be God above gods by forever overcoming death through his resurrection (Acts 17:31). 

This is the good news of Acts. Despite persecution, the Kingdom of God is moving toward all nations and all peoples. Even as opportunities died among the Jews, new life is coming to the Gentiles. 

And this work continues today. You and I can be included in the Kingdom of God no matter where we are because Jesus is sending his good news out to all nations. And we also get to continue this good work by taking the message of Jesus throughout the earth with all boldness (Matthew 28:19). 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who is bringing the light of his Kingdom to every nation on earth. And may you see Jesus as the one whose death and resurrection earn all who trust in him entry into that Kingdom. "

With the coming of the Holy Spirit, the apostles proclaim the reign of Jesus as the King who rose from the dead and now offers forgiveness of sins and his presence through the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). 

But what about the temple? This is where God’s presence was supposed to dwell and the forgiveness of sins was offered. The temple was the closest thing Israel had to the authority of a throne. The Gospel of Jesus challenged this. 

The tension between Jesus and the temple comes to a head in Acts 3-4. As Peter and John enter the temple to pray, they see a lame man begging outside the gates (Acts 3:2). The Law prohibited crippled animals from being sacrificed and disabled priests from serving (Leviticus 21:21). But this wrongly led to people with defects actually being kept out of the temple.

When Peter and John heal the man in Jesus’ name, he immediately jumps up and leaps right into the temple courts (Acts 3:8). The onlookers are astonished (Acts 3:11). What power did Peter use to perform this miracle (Acts 3:12)? Peter explains that Jesus healed him (Acts 3:16). Healing and salvation are not found in the temple anymore, but in the name of Jesus. 

This bold claim is backed up when Peter shows that everything in the Old Testament, including the expectations of Abraham, Moses, and all the prophets, are fulfilled in Jesus (Acts 3:22-25). His resurrection from the dead is the proof (Acts 3:15). Faith in Jesus’ sacrifice—not animal sacrifices—is what brings forgiveness and renewal (Acts 3:19). 

The temple authorities are disturbed by this teaching, so they arrest Peter and John (Acts 4:3). The rulers had put their trust in their building but missed the point. Peter quotes Psalm 118:22 to rebuke the them, saying, “Jesus is ‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone’” (Acts 4:11). The true temple is Jesus, whom they rejected and crucified (Acts 4:10).

The strongest words come next. While standing in the temple that bears God’s name (1 Kings 8:29), Peter says only one name can save—the name of Jesus (Acts 4:12). 

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus is the new temple. Because Jesus is God himself, he is also the fullest dwelling place of God. What the temple symbolized, Jesus actualizes. Moreover, his atoning death fully accomplishes what the sacrifices of the temple hinted at. Sacrifices had to be offered in the temple daily. But Jesus is the final, once-for-all sacrifice (Hebrews 10:10).

This is good news for poor and helpless beggars like us. Jesus comes to us as the apostles came to the beggar in Acts, and all we have to do is ask for help (Acts 3:3). When we do, we don’t have to beg anymore. We get to run into God’s presence with leaps of joy (Hebrews 4:16). 

Our sins are not temporarily atoned for through daily sacrifices, but are now completely wiped out on Jesus’ cross (Acts 3:19). 

Furthermore, we are made into new temples in whom the Holy Spirit dwells (Acts 4:31). No longer do we beg outside the temple of God’s presence. Instead, we are now the temple in which he is pleased to dwell. 

Like Peter, no matter who opposes or plots against us, we can proclaim Jesus with great boldness because we are no longer outcast beggars; we are filled with the Spirit of God (Acts 4:25-26, 31).

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who has authority over every event, institution, and power. And may you see Jesus as the one whom God has vested with all authority and who uses his power to forgive, heal, and bring us near. "

Paul leaves Ephesus and heads for Jerusalem, where he is sure to be horribly persecuted (Acts 20:23). Regardless of the inevitable suffering, Paul is determined to return to Jerusalem (Acts 21:13-14). 

Paul enters a seven-day process of ritual purification after his travels among the Gentiles. He also performs an act of charity, paying for the offerings needed for four poor believers in Jerusalem to finish the vows they made to God (Acts 21:23-24). 

But Jews from Asia seize Paul and stir up a riot by accusing him of bringing Gentiles into the temple (Acts 21:28). The crowd seeks to put Paul to death until the local Roman authorities intervene (Acts 21:32). They put Paul in protective custody and allow him to give a defense before the mob (Acts 21:40). 

Paul explains that he is a Jew who used to persecute Christians like the crowd now persecutes him (Acts 22:3). But after seeing the risen Jesus on his way to Damascus, Paul is called to take the good news of the Messiah to the Gentiles (Acts 22:21). When Paul mentions Gentiles, the crowd again becomes enraged and forcefully ends his speech (Acts 22:22). 

The next day, Paul is brought before the Jewish council of leaders (Acts 22:30). Paul shrewdly brings up his hope in the resurrection from the dead, a theological point that divides the leadership (Acts 23:9). This deteriorates the proceedings and the Romans take Paul back into protective custody (Acts 23:10). 

While in prison, Jesus speaks to Paul, telling him that he will testify in Rome (Acts 23:11). The fulfilment of this word starts in earnest when the Roman guards hear of a plot among the Jews to kill Paul (Acts 23:21). To keep Paul safe, they send him under guard to the Roman governor Felix where he is to receive a proper hearing (Acts 23:35). 

Where is the Gospel?

Paul’s journey to Jerusalem looks like Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem. From his determination to travel there despite guaranteed persecution (Luke 18:31) to his mob-like arrest (Luke 22:52) and false trial resulting in the intervention of Roman authorities (Luke 23:4), Paul is walking in the footsteps of Jesus. Just as Jesus died for both Jews and Gentiles, Paul, a Jew, is putting his life on the line for the sake of the Gentiles. 

Paul argues that the ceremonially unclean Gentiles should be allowed to draw near God, as pictured by going into the temple. That is why Paul cleans himself up and pays the price of atonement for the four poor believers. He shows both Jews and Gentiles that through Jesus all the unclean can be brought near and the debts of the poor are paid. 

Paul points out that the Jews accuse him without credible witnesses, as the law requires (Acts 23:3; Deuteronomy 19:15). If the Gentiles are lawbreakers, so are they. Yet, the Jews are still allowed in the temple. The Jews fail to recognize that their inclusion in God’s family, as well as the Gentiles, is not based on their obedience but on God who chose them.

Paul’s actions form a living parable, to show that, through Jesus, God has now chosen Jew and Gentile alike. This is good news for those who feel on the outside of religious groups, social norms, cultural acceptability, or the ethnic majority. Because Jesus paid for our atonement and makes us clean, we are accepted in his presence and anywhere we go. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who uses oppression and persecution to bring good news to the world. And may you see Jesus as the one who died under oppression to bring that good news to every nation, language, and people. "

He proved this most clearly in his resurrection from the dead.",Website,Acts Bible Study,"What’s Happening? 

Paul continues spreading the Gospel among the nations, but twice the Holy Spirit prevents him and then calls him to go to Macedonia—a large region across the sea. Not only is this the first missionary journey to bring the Gospel into what we know as Europe today, but it brings the Gospel message that much closer to the heart of the Roman empire—and therefore to the ends of the earth. 

At least two conflicts can be traced through Paul’s journey in Macedonia. 

First, the Jews continue to oppose Paul. When Paul enters a city, he first goes to the synagogues and explains that the Jew’s long awaited Messiah has come in Jesus (Acts 17:2-3). While some Jews believe, many incite revolts against Paul and his companions (Acts 17:4-5). This oppression comes to a climax in Corinth when Paul says to the Jews, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles” (Acts 18:6). 

Second, conflict arises between the Kingdom of Jesus and the kingdom of Rome. Roman identity centers on the worship of gods, including the emperor. Paul preaches a new Kingdom with a new divine Ruler—and opposition follows. In Philippi, Paul is beaten and thrown in prison after being accused of teaching a way of life that is contradictory to Rome (Acts 16:20-23). In Thessalonica, he is forced out of town following accusations of preaching a message that turns the world upside down by “defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus” (Acts 17:6-7). 

This conflict comes to a climax in Athens where Paul sees a city full of idols and temples built for false Roman gods (Acts 17:16). Paul preaches a bold sermon to the crowds and philosophers of Athens, calling their gods products of their own imagination.  He tells them to repent and believe the one true God revealed in the risen Jesus (Acts 17:29-31). The Athenians mock Paul for this message, but a handful believe (Acts 17:32, 34). 

Where is the Gospel?

The good news may be best represented by the story of the Philippian jailor, who almost took his own life after God set Paul free from prison. Instead, Paul preaches the Gospel to him, and his whole family is saved (Acts 16:26-27, 33). 

God demonstrates that Jesus’ Kingdom is stronger than Rome and will triumph in the end. Christians need not fear any ruler, government, power, or threat. God is able to deliver us from every kind of prison, even the enemy’s greatest prison—death itself.

Jesus was also wrongfully condemned and sentenced to death by Roman and Jewish authorities (Luke 23:22-25). But he proves his Kingdom is greater when (like Paul) he burst out of the prison of death in his resurrection and proclaimed the way of salvation to those of us on the verge of death. 

As we see with the Philippian jailor, this news has come to the ends of the earth. While we mourn with Paul at the rejection of the Gospel by many Jews (Romans 9:3), we also rejoice that God is bringing those far from him into his family (Romans 9:25)

As the Lord said to Paul after being rejected by the Jews in Corinth, “Keep on speaking, do not be silent...because I have many people in this city” (Acts 18:9-10). God is calling people all over the world out of their prisons and into his salvation.

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who is stronger than any person, power, or prison. And may you see Jesus as the Lord of all who conquered the greatest power of all—our prison of sin and death. "

After riots, beatings, and assassination plots, Paul’s life seems to slow down under a somewhat comfortable house arrest in the governor’s quarters (Acts 23:35). 

Luke describes how more than two years of court cases and political maneuvers decide Paul’s fate. After the Jewish leaders accuse him of being a ringleader of a religious sect that profanes the temple and breaks the Old Testament law, Paul gives three arguments in his defense (Acts 24:5-6).

First, Paul reminds the authorities that they can find no evidence to confirm his accuser’s claims that he defiled the temple (Acts 24:18). Luke records the same earlier in Acts (Acts 21:27). 

Paul’s second defense is about his observance of the law. Far from being guilty of breaking the law, Paul used to be a Pharisee who kept the law with great vigor (Acts 26:5). By following Jesus now, Paul  is actually keeping the law because the whole Old Testament points to Jesus as the promised Messiah (Acts 26:22-23). 

Paul’s third and final defense is more of a concession (Acts 24:21). He says there is one true thing he said that upset the Jews—his belief in the final resurrection of the dead (Acts 24:15). This will be the day that God raises both the good and the evil, the just and the unjust, to pronounce over them all his final word of blessing or judgment. 

Though the Jews fail to bring a credible case against Paul, the local Roman authorities prove themselves to be inept and selfish judges. No one seems able to decide what to do with Paul or his message about Jesus. 

Finally, after two years of being held as a political prisoner, Paul appeals to Caesar (Acts 25:11). As a Roman citizen, the authorities have no choice but to send him to Rome, the very place God told Paul he must proclaim the name of Jesus (Acts 23:11). 

Where is the Gospel?

Paul’s central appeal to the final resurrection of both the just and unjust is crucial to understanding this passage and the Gospel that Paul preaches. 

Many Jews believed that at the final resurrection God will judge every person who has ever lived (Acts 24:15a). God’s judgment must be seen in direct conflict with the false accusations, bumbling court system, and political self-interest. 

When Jesus returns, he will judge everyone perfectly and with complete justice (2 Timothy 4:1). No bureaucratic corruption, no slanderous misrepresentation, no judicial unintelligence, bias, or self-interest will compromise the exactness of Jesus’ rule against every person. 

The good news is that justice will be done. Wrongs will be righted. 

Paul was tried and questioned though he was innocent. He needed someone to come and declare him not guilty of the charges pressed against him. The same thing happens to believers every day. Our enemy wants to condemn those of us who believe in Jesus even though we are innocent. He wants us to feel guilty even though we are not (Romans 8:1). 

But when we hold fast to the good news of Jesus’ death and resurrection we are declared innocent, for we are filled with the light of Christ (Acts 26:23). Our only hope is to do what Paul begs the rulers in this passage to do—believe in Jesus (Acts 26:27). At the judgment seat of Christ there will be no higher court of appeals (2 Corinthians 5:10). Our appeal will be in Christ alone. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who brings the whole world under his perfect justice. And may you see Jesus as the one who frees us from the justice we deserve to give us the grace we don’t deserve. "

The Kingdom of God has come to Jerusalem and her fractured neighbors—Samaria, Galilee, and Judea (Acts 9:31). But now, something even more scandalous is happening. Peter is the first to experience it. 

Through a series of events, God moves Peter toward a new understanding of cleanliness and uncleanliness when it comes to Jews and Gentiles. 

Peter arrives in the seaside city of Joppa, the same city where the prophet Jonah tried to run from his calling to take God’s message to the Gentiles (Jonah 1:3). Peter raises a Christian woman named Tabitha from the dead. Her name means “deer”—a traditionally clean animal for the Jews (Acts 9:36, Deuteronomy 14:4-5). Yet Peter stays in the house of a tanner, someone the Jews avoided because they handled dead animals (Acts 9:43).

God is inching Peter toward a new understanding of how his mission, the Gentiles, and the Old Testament Law all work together. 

While at the tanner’s house, Peter has a vision of clean and unclean animals. When God tells him to eat, Peter refuses. But God responds with stunning words: “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean” (Acts 10:9-15). 

Immediately after this, a messenger summons Peter to Caesarea to meet a Gentile named Cornelius (Acts 10:22). Caesarea was the capital and the seat of Roman power in the area—as Gentile as you can get. There, in Cornelius’ household, Peter preaches the Gospel and the Holy Spirit falls on the unclean Gentiles just as it fell on the Jews at Pentecost (Acts 10:44). 

This news spreads quickly, and Peter receives criticism for associating with Gentiles (Acts 11:1-4). But Peter shares his story and the disciples praise God for bringing the Gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 11:18). This is seen in the following story where Barnabas and Saul minister to Gentiles in Antioch. There they are first called Christians (Acts 11:20-26).

Where is the Gospel?

God chose the Jews as his covenant people. As part of this, he gave them regulations about what to eat (Deuteronomy 14:2-3). Eating an unclean animal would make them unclean (Leviticus 11:24). If they were unclean and touched something holy, they were cut off from God’s people (Leviticus 7:21). They first needed to be made clean before they could come near God’s holy presence (Leviticus 11:25). 

In the same way, Gentiles could not come near to a holy God because of their uncleanliness (Leviticus 18:24). But, by the coming of the Holy Spirit, God made them clean by coming near to them. God simply declared them clean, and they were cleansed (Acts 11:9). 

This is only possible because of the Gospel Peter preached (Acts 10:39-40). The clean and holy God came near to an unclean and impure world in the person of Jesus. Jesus died and rose to offer a cleansing sacrifice, not just for Jews, but for all who believe (Acts 10:43). The sacrifices from the Old Testament needed to purify the unclean have been made in Jesus' death (1 John 1:7). 

This is the good news for all of us. We may feel dirty, unclean, and unable to approach God. But by his death Jesus calls us clean, raises us to life, and makes us holy through his Spirit.

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who chooses those far from him and brings them close. And may you see Jesus as the one who takes our uncleanliness and gives us his own holiness. "

A believer named Stephen became well known for performing great wonders and signs among the people (Acts 6:8). After Jewish leaders  falsely accuse him, they arrest Stephen and put him on trial (Acts 6:12). They bring two charges against him: that he preached the destruction of the temple and that he opposed the Law of Moses (Acts 6:14). 

In his defense, Stephen launches into the longest speech in the book of Acts. 

He addresses the  accusations about the temple by  repeatedly mentioning instances where God showed up and worked outside Jerusalem and the temple (Acts 7:2, 4, 9, 15, 22, 30, 36, 38, 44). God is not confined to “houses made by human hands” (Acts 7:48). 

The temple leaders also condemn Stephen for breaking the Law of Moses. But in reality, they and their ancestors constantly rejected its core teaching. The Law should have made them expect a descendent of Abraham who, like Moses, would finally save God’s people (Acts 7:5, 37, 39-44). Stephen reveals the cycle of rejection that Israel has had toward God and his messengers throughout their history (Acts 7:52).

Stephen proclaims this promised descendant is the same Jesus they killed on a cross (Acts 7:52). Yet Stephen looks up and says he sees Jesus as the “Son of Man,” resurrected, full of the glory, and seated at God’s right hand (Acts 7:56). 

Ultimately, this is what gets Stephen killed because it is a reference to Daniel’s vision when he sees one like a Son of Man seated next to God (Daniel 7:13). 

The temple leaders will hear none of it (Acts 7:54). They drag Stephen into the streets and stone him for blasphemy, continuing their ancestors’ cycle of rejection (Acts 7:57-58). The leaders believe they are fulfilling the Law (Leviticus 24:14). But in reality, they are breaking it (Acts 7:53). 

Where is the Gospel? 

Stephen is stoned for one simple reason. By naming Jesus as the Son of Man from Daniel, he claims that Jesus is equal with God. What is blasphemous and bad news to the  temple leader’s ears is bafflingly good news to us. 

Stephen proves that God is not bound to the temple. In fact, through the person of Jesus, God appears to thousands of people in all kinds of settings (Matthew 15:30). 

Jesus fulfills the temple because he brings God outside in flesh and blood (John 14:9). He is both God and man (John 8:59). This is what Daniel saw in his vision—a heavenly human (Daniel 7:13).

Stephen also argues that he is not breaking the law, but instead fulfilling it by claiming Jesus is the promised Son of Man from the Old Testament. Breaking the law leads to death, but keeping it leads to life (Deuteronomy 4:1). 

Stephen’s speech shows that we don’t only break the law by refusing to obey commands, but by refusing to believe in the one it points to—Jesus (John 5:39-40). This leads to death. But the opposite is also true. When we put our trust in Jesus we keep the law, which leads to life (Galatians 3:22). 

When we share Stephen’s vision and see Jesus as God, we will live forever in the eternal kingdom of the Son of Man, the eternal King (Daniel 7:14).

Jesus has risen, the Holy Spirit has fallen, and the age of the Church has dawned in Jerusalem. With this new age comes new authority for the religious community of Israel. Acts 4-5 explores this change in authority from the current leaders of Israel to the apostles of the newly formed church.

The church acts like Israel was supposed to—a place where no one was poor or needy (Deuteronomy 15:4). The early Christians demonstrate this reality by selling their possessions and giving the proceeds to the apostles to redistribute among the needy (4:34-35). 

Two stories highlight this activity. First, a land-owning Levite (who according to the law was not permitted to own land) repents, sells his land, and gives the money to the apostles (Acts 4:36-37; Deuteronomy 10:9). Traditionally, gifts were brought to Levites who worked in the temple (Leviticus 6:14). But now authority has shifted to the apostles (Acts 4:33). 

In the second story a husband and wife, Ananias and Sapphira, also sell their land (Acts 5:1). They claim to bring all the proceeds from the sale of their property to the feet of the apostles, but they actually y bring only a portion of it (Acts 5:2). At a word from the apostle Peter, they drop dead (Acts 5:10). The apostles were appointed to lead on behalf of God, so this deceitful couple was lying to God (Acts 5:4). In both stories, we see that authority is moving from Israel to the church. 

This tension comes to a head as the religious authorities arrest the apostles for performing many miraculous signs (Acts 5:12, 17-18). But God sends an angel to free them, proving to everyone who is really in charge (Acts 5:19). 

Israel’s leaders gather to figure out what to do (Acts 5:21b). A well-respected Pharisee named Gamaliel says that if God is on the side of the church and the apostles, then no authority can stop it (Acts 5:38). 

Where is the Gospel?

All authority is meant to reflect God’s authority (Genesis 1:27-28). However, Israel’s leadership misrepresented God’s authority for hundreds of years (2 Chronicles 36:14-16). 

Now the apostles are obeying God (Acts 5:29, 32). They take care of the poor, heal the sick, free the possessed, and liberate the imprisoned (Acts 5:16). What God had long promised is now happening through the apostles (Isaiah 61:1). 

This demonstrates God’s authority and kingdom on earth is now through the “church” (Acts 5:11). The church is the spiritual descendent of Israel, tasked with the beautiful role of bringing good news to the world. 

This good news is not only relief for the oppressed, but justice against the oppressors. e see this in the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira. They stole what they had pledged to the poor and in turn received God’s justice (Acts 5:2). 

Ultimately, Jesus has all authority in heaven, on earth, and over the church (Colossians 1:16-18). His authority and reign bring healing, equity, and justice. Our ruler Jesus now empowers us with his Spirit—the same Holy Spirit given to the apostles (Acts 5:32). Now we can go and bring good news, healing, generosity, and grace to those who need it most.

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who has all authority, but uses it to care for those who have none. And may you see Jesus as the good King who invites us into the good work of living in his Kingdom. "

Opposition is a constant theme throughout Acts. The Gospel is opposed by Jews, local government officials, other religions, and everyday people (Acts 17:5, 8, 32; 16:19). But the greatest test is still before Paul, who desires to go straight to the heart of opposition in Jerusalem and then to Rome (Acts 19:21). 

But before Paul faces outside opposition from Rome and Jerusalem, he must first face inside opposition from the Jesus movement itself (Acts 18:22-23). 

In two back-to-back stories we read about a man named Apollos and 12 disciples who only know the baptism of John the Baptist (Acts 18:24-25; 19:3). John’s baptism was about preparation and expectation (Acts 19:4), but now the fulfillment has come in the Kingdom brought by Jesus. And as the Kingdom spreads, opposition follows.

After three months of teaching in Ephesus—a city steeped in sorcery and idol worship—Paul turns his attention from the Jews to the mixed public (Acts 19:9). God grants Paul extraordinary miracles that overturn the Ephesians’ way of life (Acts 19:11). They stop worshipping idols, quit practicing sorcery, and publicly burn their expensive scrolls of spells (Acts 19:19).

This causes a massive riot instigated by those whose idol-making businesses are hurt by Paul’s teaching (Acts 19:26-27). A huge crowd seizes Paul’s companions, drags them to a public theater, and chants praise of their deity Artemis for two hours straight (Acts 19:34). 

The opposition against the Gospel comes to its highest point in a farewell speech Paul gives to the elders of the Ephesian church (Acts 20:17). In this speech Paul says he is going to Jerusalem and the Holy Spirit has all but guaranteed him that he will be imprisoned and persecuted upon arrival (Acts 20:23). Yet, Paul goes with confidence.

Where is the Gospel? 

Jesus promises that his church will be persecuted because he was persecuted (John 15:20). Paul says joining Jesus in his suffering is good news because it confirms that you will also join him in his resurrection (Philippians 3:10). 

Jesus also says that his Kingdom will be like the tiniest mustard seed that, when planted, becomes the largest plant in a garden (Matthew 13:32). As Paul and his small movement are persecuted in city after city, we continue to hear reports that the church is growing (Acts 19:20). Persecution becomes positive proof that God is with them; it is the way God grows the church. 

This shouldn’t surprise us. The idea that oppression leads to growth is found at the heart of the Gospel. Jesus was oppressed unto death. But after the seed of his body was planted in the ground, he rose to create a massive harvest of those saved from death (John 12:24).

Ultimately, the good news of this passage is that no religious in-fighting or opposition, no societal authority or movement, no demonic power or stronghold can stand in the way of the Kingdom Jesus is building. The death and resurrection of Jesus prove that, regardless of how we might be suffering, God is and can work good out of it. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who cannot be conquered by any amount of opposition. And may you see Jesus as the one who turns persecution into victory in his death and resurrection. "

Paul and Barnabas have carried the Gospel to the Gentiles like never before (Acts 13:47). Now, they return to their home base in Antioch where they encounter teachers with a divisive message (Acts 14:26). 

According to these teachers, the law of Moses commands that Gentiles be circumcised in order to be saved (Acts 15:1). This issue stirs up enough controversy that the leaders of the church gather in Jerusalem to settle it. 

Believers belonging to the party of the Pharisees argue that circumcision is necessary for salvation (Acts 15:5). But Peter refutes this by recounting what happened in Cornelius’ house—how God chose, cleansed, and gave the Spirit to these believers without circumcision (Acts 15:7-9).

Peter recalls how none of Israel’s forefathers perfectly kept the law. If either Jews or Gentiles are to be saved, it will be in the same way, “through the grace of the Lord Jesus.” (Acts 15:10-11). 

The counsel in Jerusalem drafts a letter to the churches in Antioch and the surrounding regions (Acts 15:22-23), formally rejecting the teachings of those who preach the necessity of circumcision (15:22-24). It also commands Gentile Christians to abstain from their cultural practices tied to idol worship (15:29). This command enables the Gentile believers to sacrificially love their Jewish brothers and sisters and bring greater unity to the church.

Where is the Gospel?

After Peter’s speech about Gentile inclusion, James agrees with a quote from the prophet  Amos. God promised a day when he would come to Israel and restore his Kingdom (Acts 15:16). This is what Jesus did when he defeated death and rose to his heavenly throne. But also at that time, God would call Gentiles out from all the nations to be his people (Acts 15:17). 

James shows that the inclusion of the Gentiles doesn’t create a problem with the law—it is always the point of the law. Including Gentiles doesn’t mean they are forgetting circumcision—they are actually fulfilling it.

The Jews who advocated circumcision were pushing a standard they constantly failed to meet. If salvation comes through obeying the law, no one will be saved (Romans 3:20). 

That’s why it is such good news that we are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone (Romans 3:22). If salvation is based on our good deeds outweighing our bad deeds, not even the most virtuous person will qualify. So how can any of us be saved? Peter says it clearly here: “We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved” (Acts 15:11). 

Through the Gospel of his death and resurrection, Jesus graciously forgives all the ways we break his commands (Romans 8:3). And it is this grace and forgiveness to all who believe in him that brings his Kingdom and fulfills his law (Amos 9:12). This is good news for those of us who, like the Gentiles, may feel far from God. The consummation of all God has been doing in the world since the beginning of time is wrapped up in the Gentiles’ inclusion in the Jewish nation. 

Moreover, Jesus is doing something new that the law can never do. He is writing his law on our hearts (Acts 15:8; Jeremiah 31:33). God is creating a people who truly carry out his law, not by demanding obedience, but by saving them through grace. He transforms us into new people who actually can obey with our hearts. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who gives us grace when we truly don’t deserve it. And may you see Jesus as the one who does all the work necessary to bring that grace to all who ask. "

Acts 13 begins the second and final section of Acts. It repeats main themes from the first section, but now the focus is on Saul’s mission to the Gentiles. 

Peter’s ministry in Jerusalem begins with the selection of Matthias and the presence of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:26, 2:4). In the same way Saul's missionary journey begins when the church in Antioch selects Saul and Barnabas by the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:2). 

Saul mirrors the apostles by overcoming the influence of a pagan magician, just as Philip and Peter did in Acts 8 (Acts 13:8-10). The author highlights this shift to the nations when he writes that Saul, a Jewish name, also went by Paul, a Roman and Greek name (Acts 13:9).

Just like Peter and Stephen, Paul gives long speeches to show how Jesus fulfills Scripture as  the promised Messiah (Acts 17:2-3; 2:30; 7:52). He explains how God remained faithful throughout Israel’s history and now brings salvation through Jesus to the Jews and Gentiles (Acts 13:17, 26). His message serves as a template for his presentation of the Gospel throughout the rest of Acts.

Just like Peter’s message in Jerusalem, many Jews initially believe. Others object and even persecute Paul and Barnabas until they leave the region (Acts 13:43-45, 50). 

This pattern of preaching and persecution continues in chapter 14, as Paul travels through Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe (Acts 14:19). The Gentiles believe, even though they are so far removed from the Jewish faith that they worship Paul and Barnabas as Greek gods (Acts 14:12). But again and again, the Jews stir up trouble for the church (Acts 14:19). 

Where is the Gospel?

Clearly the mission of God is not complete until his Kingdom has gone to the ends of the earth. In Acts 13, Paul quotes from Isaiah 49:6, which says that the Servant of the Lord will be a light to the Gentiles and bring salvation to the ends of the earth (Acts 13:47). This is exactly what we see unfolding as the church carries the message of Jesus from Jerusalem to the nations. 

Early in Luke’s Gospel, a righteous man at the temple named Simeon sees Jesus as a child and calls him “a light to the Gentiles” in fulfillment of this prophecy (Luke 2:32).

Jesus fulfills his role as God’s Servant by making a way for all nations to come to God. He does this by providing forgiveness of sins, not through obedience to the law of Moses, but through his death and resurrection (Acts 13:38-39).

Now Paul and Barnabas continue to fulfill the role of Isaiah’s Servant as they carry the news of eternal life in Jesus to the world (Acts 13:47-48). 

The same is true for us today. Not only has the good news of God’s Servant Jesus reached us and saved us, but we also get to be included in this fulfillment of God’s purposes for the world. We are his servants, taking the light of the Gospel to a dark world (Matthew 5:14).

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes to see the God who has been working through all of human history to reconcile all nations to himself. And may you see Jesus as the promised Servant who died in our place and rose from the grave to send us out into the world with good news on our lips.  "

With mounting persecution, many in the church in Jerusalem flee to other cities and countries (Acts 8:1) Saul, a man behind much of the violence against Christians, is on a mission to track down the fleeing believers and take them as prisoners to Jerusalem (Acts 9:2). 

But on his way, a heavenly light interrupts Saul’s evil mission. He encounters the risen Jesus (Acts 9:3). This encounter echoes moments when God appears in the Old Testament (Exodus 19:9, 16). The point is clear—Jesus is the Lord. 

Saul’s blindness is a physical representation of his spiritual blindness (Acts 9:8). He cannot see who Jesus truly is. He intended to enter the city to harm others, yet now he is the one inflicted (Acts 9:9). 

God calls a local Christian named Ananias to lay hands on Saul and heal him, declaring that Saul will take the Gospel to the nations. Ananias is afraid of Saul, but obeys. Immediately Saul is filled with the Holy Spirit, recovers his sight, and is baptized (Acts 9:17-18). Like Abraham, God selects Saul to be a blessing to all nations (Genesis 12:3). The Gospel had come to Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria—and now through Saul and others it would travel to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). 

Saul is completely transformed. He meant to snuff out the Gospel, but now he preaches it. And in a strange twist, he has to flee for his own life to Jerusalem (Acts 9:20-26). Instead of imprisoning Christians, Saul himself has been taken captive by Christ. His transformation leads to a time of peace for Christians in Judea and Samaria (Acts 9:31).

Where is the Gospel?

In Saul, we see the goodness and grace of Jesus on full display. Instead of God’s blazing presence striking Saul down for his hard heart and murderous intent toward the church (Numbers 17:13), God saves Saul’s life and the church grows. 

This moment highlights how God’s power and grace constantly reverse what we expect. 

This is good news because, deep down, we share Ananias’ fear. He thought Saul was too evil to save, too evil for God to use (Acts 9:13). We too believe there are people, movements, and organizations so opposed to God or his church, that he cannot possibly use them for good.

But the Gospel shows us this isn't true. God used the evil system of Rome and the proud movement of the Pharisees to crucify Jesus on a cross. But the cross meant for the death of Jesus, actually brings life to the whole world. 

But what about when we feel like Saul and think we are too evil for God to save or use us? The story of Saul shows that an encounter with Jesus can take the worst of us and turn us into God’s chosen instruments (1 Timothy 1:15). An encounter with Jesus can take a murderer and turn him into a life-giver. 

All of us, no matter our backgrounds or history, are called to continue the same work for which Saul was saved. We who have encountered the Gospel of Jesus are now filled with the Holy Spirit to take the message of Jesus to the ends of the earth. We are carriers of this good news. No matter who you are or what you’ve done, the grace and power of the crucified and risen Jesus can save you and use you for the glory of God. 

See For Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes like he opened Saul’s to see the God who restores sight to the spiritually blind. And may you see Jesus as the one who suffers with us so that even death is turned into life. "
