God brings good out of evil. He proves this in the story of Joseph. 

After being sold into slavery, Joseph also becomes wrongly imprisoned for resisting the sexual advances of his master’s wife (39:20). While in jail, God makes sure Joseph’s endeavors succeed so that he becomes a prison warden. While serving in this position, Joseph interprets two dreams that both come true (40:21-22). So when Pharaoh has a dream himself Joseph is called upon, and accurately interprets his dream as well. 

The dream is a warning that God is about to bring seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine in Egypt (41:25). 

For Joseph’s insight, Pharaoh appoints him to second in command. The famine comes just as Joseph said it would. But since they were prepared, Joseph was able to provide stored up grain to all the nations that came to them for help. 

This story allows us to both compare and contrast what God does through Joseph with the rest of Israel’s story. 

Joseph’s brothers tried to make him a slave, but God made him a king. Judah gave into sexual temptation with Tamar, but Joseph resisted it. Whereas so much of the sin surrounding this story points to God’s grace in the midst of evil, Joseph’s goodness points to the fact that God can raise up a righteous person out of the worst situations. 

Under Joseph’s care, the food in Egypt was fruitful and multiplied, as God promised Abraham his children would be. The text even says that the “world” came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph (41:57). So here we get a foretaste of all the nations of the earth being blessed through Abraham’s descendants. 

But the people aren’t fruitful, just the food. And the nations aren’t being blessed with God’s presence, just with grain. It is an incomplete fulfillment. 

Where is the Gospel? 

That is why we must see Jesus in this story as well. 

Joseph may have been righteous by comparison, but Jesus is the only one who is perfectly righteous. Jesus is the one who not only resisted sexual temptation from one woman but was tempted in every way and never sinned (Hebrews 4:15). 

Unlike Joseph, Jesus willingly came to earth to make himself a slave to all, even to the point of death (Philippians 2:7-8). He did not just descend into a prison, but into the jail that imprisons all humanity - the grave itself (1 Pt 3:19). Yet, God used Jesus’ death to bring him to the throne above every throne (Phil 2:9). 

The story of Joseph shows us a partial, incomplete, fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham. Jesus, however, brings complete fulfillment. Jesus multiplies his spiritual blessings to us. He is the bread of life that feeds us in the direst seasons of life’s famines (Jn 6:35). 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit shows you the God who brings good out of the worst evil and that you would see that Jesus underwent the worst of our evil to bring the whole world the greatest good. "

The world as Judah knows it will soon be destroyed by God’s burning anger against the pride, violence, and idolatry of her leaders. The only one's sheltered on that day are the humble (Zephaniah 2:3). In chapters two and three, Zephaniah offers multiple prophecies explaining that God’s purifying fire will desolate those currently in power and leave behind a world without pride and evil for the humble to inherit. 

The economic centers of the rival nation Philistia will crash and their trading routes will fall (Zephaniah 2:4-5). The aftermath of God's purifying fire will turn Philistine civilization into pastureland (Zephaniah 2:6). And the people of Judah will live as humble shepherds in the ruins of a once proud economic superpower (Zephaniah 2:7). 

The nations Moab and Ammon have been arrogant, insulting, and threatening to Judah (Zephaniah 2:8, 10). Confident in their own gods, they see Israel’s God as weak. But the God of Israel will destroy the gods of Moab and Ammon (Zephaniah 2:11). The lands those deities protect, God will turn into pits of sulfur and salt (Zephaniah 2:9a). But the humble survivors who trust God will plunder what isn’t burned (Zephaniah 2:9b).

Assyria boasts that her capital, Nineveh, is unique among the world (Zephaniah 2:15a). But all the cultural accomplishments and pleasures of that city will dry up in the desert heat (Zephaniah 2:13). And where a once-indulgent culture ran wild, simple animals will make their homes (Zephaniah 2:14).

Zephaniah says God hoped his anger at the world that Judah so closely copied would lead her to turn away from her pride, violence, and idolatry (Zephaniah 3:6-7). He hoped his purifying fire would cause Judah to become a kingdom for all the humble of the world to flock to. But since it hasn’t, God tells proud Judah to wait for her inevitable destruction (Zephaniah 3:8).

As God’s people they carried a special calling to image God’s moral purity, love, and generosity to a watching world (Zephaniah 3:5). Instead, they have watched the world and imaged the oppression, rebellion, and impurity of it (Zephaniah 3:1). Disobedient, Judah’s rulers are lions and wolves, her prophets are treacherous, and her priests are profane (Zephaniah 3:2-4). Judah will be the last and least nation God will purify.

Where is the Gospel?

The purpose of God’s fire is not annihilation but purity. God’s fire humiliates the proud but raises the humble. God hoped that when Judah saw God’s fire among the nations, it would cause her to turn from her pride and become a kingdom where the humble would flock. God hopes the same for us through Jesus. 

Like Judah, Jesus carried a special calling to image God's moral purity, love, and generosity to a watching world (Hebrews 1:3). And he did so perfectly! He was God’s image in the flesh. But Jesus also experienced God’s burning anger against Judah’s pride. The apostle Paul even says Jesus became sin for his people (2 Corinthians 5:21). Just as the failings of Judah’s leaders brought God’s fire on themselves and the world, Jesus invited God’s purifying fire on himself in the world’s place. And like Zephaniah hoped, on the other side of God’s fire, the humble and the poor inherit God’s Kingdom on the earth (Matthew 5:3, 5).

In Judah's time, God's purifying fire left behind a world for humble shepherds, wounded survivors, and wild animals to inherit. And in Jesus, it’s humble shepherds who first meet King Jesus holding court among simple animals (Luke 2:8-20). And it’s to the poor and oppressed that Jesus first preached his good news (Luke 4:18-19). Jesus’ life and death tell us that God’s purifying fire has ended an era of evil and pride—and the humble can finally inherit the earth. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see the God who purifies the world like fire. And may you see Jesus as the one that was judged so that the humble could inherit the world. "

Infamously wicked Ahab has died, and his son Jehoram has taken the throne. While he’s a marginal improvement on his father, Jehoram’s still at odds with God and his prophets (2 Kings 3:2). 

His father had annexed the neighboring nation of Moab and exacted steep taxes (2 Kings 3:4). But with Ahab dead, Moab’s king rebels (2 Kings 3:5). So Jehoram forms a coalition with Edom and Israel to march on Moab and quell the uprising (2 Kings 3:9a). But seven days into the march, there is no water for their troops or animals (2 Kings 3:9b). One member of the coalition believes God is trapping them—and in fact, he will very soon (2 Kings 3:10). But for now, at the coalition’s insistence, Jehoram seeks out a prophet for guidance (1 Kings 22:7, 2 Kings 3:11).

Providentially, Elisha is nearby. But concerned for the coalition, he also helps set God’s trap. Elisha prophesies that God will miraculously provide water in the wilderness and give Moab into their hands (2 Kings 3:17-18). But Elisha also predicts the coalition will cut down Moab’s trees, plug its rivers, and pollute its farmland (2 Kings 3:19). This is a prediction of disobedience. God’s law specifically forbids this type of scorched-earth warfare and comes with steep consequences (Deuteronomy 20:19). But these kings have forgotten this and don’t think to interpret this prophecy any further. God’s traps are set.

The next morning the desert fills with water (2 Kings 3:20). But the red sand and the desert sun make the miracle lake look like blood (2 Kings 3:22). The Moabites assume this means Israel’s fragile coalition has violently imploded, so they move to collect the spoil (2 Kings 3:23). But Israel and Edom are waiting, and the Moabites are easily ambushed (2 Kings 3:24). Israel marches on, fells Moab’s trees, and razes its farmland (2 Kings 3:25). Elisha’s prophecies have all come true. But the battle isn’t over. 

Cornered, Moab’s king burns his oldest son as a human sacrifice to his gods in hopes of a miraculous victory (2 Kings 3:27a). Moab’s gods don’t respond, but Israel’s God does. God attacks Israel and forces them to retreat (2 Kings 3:27b). What should have been an easy victory turns into a humiliating loss. Furious at the coalition’s selective hearing and neglect of his law, God uses Moab’s idolatry and infanticide to judge the ambitions of Ahab’s son. 

Where is the Gospel?

Jehoram is the second king in Ahab’s family to be humiliated by an under-interpreted and, therefore, misleading prophecy (1 Kings 22:22). It’s an uncomfortable thought that God can trap and trick not only his enemies but his people. It’s even more disconcerting to think that God’s prophet speaking God’s word doesn’t guarantee we know what God is up to. But a God of surprise endings is ultimately a good thing.

God is a God who upsets our expectations and turns things on their head. This isn’t because he’s malicious or because he enjoys watching people like Jehoram squirm (Ezekiel 33:11). No, God is good, loving, and life-giving. God wants the best for his people, but God is also a God of the unexpected. We should expect to be surprised by him.

We barely know what’s going on in our own lives, much less how to interpret our personal histories. But God's plans for us are as big as he is. God can do immeasurably more than we can ask or imagine (Ephesians 3:20). If God has not surprised you yet, perhaps you haven’t yet met God.

While God’s surprises in 2 Kings 3 serve to trap evil kings, the apostle Paul tells us that God works all things for our good, including unexpected suffering and painful misunderstandings (Romans 8:28). God will surprise the corrupt and wicked with their humiliation. But for those who love God, we will not be trapped by our sin but surprised by God’s loving and sacrificial care. 

Unlike the Moabite king who sacrificed his son to coerce the gods and save his people, Jesus is the Son of God who saves his people by freely sacrificing himself. Jesus’ death is not a manipulation of the divine but the self-humiliation of God so that forgetful, disobedient, and selectively-hearing people might be given surprising, unexpected, and undeserved victory. If nothing in your life is going the way you expect, trust that God will soon surprise you. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who sets traps for his enemies. And may you see Jesus as the one who surprises us with love, care, and victory over the grave."

Israel’s monarchy will not bring God’s Kingdom. Solomon, Israel’s most powerful king, is dead. Now, God’s people are left in the middle of an inverted Exodus story where Israel is now Egypt.

At Solomon’s death, his son inherits the kingdom. But a rival leader named Jeroboam returns from Egypt to save God’s people (1 Kings 12:1-2). Many in Israel were enslaved under Solomon’s rule and now look to Jeroboam for relief (1 Kings 12:3-4). Like Pharaoh, Solomon’s son responds to this threat by increasing the slaves’ workload (1 Kings 12:14, Exodus 5:9). Like Moses, Jeroboam leads ten of Israel’s tribes out of slavery and into the wilderness north of Jerusalem (1 Kings 12:19). But as soon as they’re free, Jeroboam builds new golden calves and tells Israel, “Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt” (1 Kings 12:28). Israel’s history has repeated itself except Israel is the oppressor, and the man from Egypt is the liberator.

Regardless, a prophet confronts Jeroboam and prophesies that a new king, Josiah, will end his idolatrous cult (1 Kings 13:2). As signs to prove his message is from God, God withers Jeroboam’s hand, and his false altar splits in two (1 Kings 13:4-5). But Jeroboam is stubborn and hard-hearted. He rebuilds the golden calves and paves the way for his dynasty’s destruction (1 Kings 14:10).

Then, in an inversion of the Passover, Jeroboam's son is sick and he sends his wife to a prophet for healing (1 Kings 14:1). But while she is still in the prophet’s doorway, he prophesies the deaths of both the boy and Jeroboam (1 Kings 14:9,12). Like the firstborn sons of Egypt, as soon as she steps on her own doorstep her son dies (Exodus 12:23; 1 Kings 14:17). 

Meanwhile Solomon’s son, in the other half of the divided kingdom, sets up his own idols and is plundered by the Egyptians (1 Kings 14:23, 25). It’s the exact reverse of Israel’s plunder of Egypt’s wealth in the days after the Passover (Exodus 12:36). And both sides in Israel’s civil war learn the same thing: idolatry leads to slavery, loss, and death.

Where is the Gospel?

Solomon’s son and Jeroboam prove that a crown is not enough to lead Israel out of their idolatrous preferences. Like their ancestors, Israel just wants to do what’s right in their own eyes (1 Kings 14:8). And for Israel, the consequence of doing evil in God’s eyes is going back to slavery (1 Kings 14:16). Ironically, Jeroboam was the master of Israel’s slaves under Solomon. Israel trusts a slaver to liberate them and ends up enslaved to new masters and new idols, and death.

Idols and images always lead to slavery. Both golden calves and images of an ideal and fulfilled life promise liberation, but turn out to be slavers. We sacrifice our relationships, our hopes, and our morality to what looks right in our own eyes but find ourselves just as trapped as before. We’re still stuck in our own inverted Exodus enslaved by what we thought was right (John 8:34). 

We don’t need an idol, we need God to liberate us. And God has shown himself, not as an image carved from wood or molded from gold, but born in the flesh. Jesus is the exact image of God and the living imprint of his nature (Hebrews 1:3). Israel hoped Josiah would liberate them. But Jesus is not only Josiah’s son but God’s--and those whom Jesus sets free are free forever (John 8:36). 

Instead of making your own sacrifices to false gods, hopes, and idols, trust that Jesus is both your God and your sacrifice. He died as a Passover lamb to invert the story of your idolatry and death. By his blood on the doors of your heart, he liberates you from slavery to sin. And by his resurrection, Jesus inverts the grave and plunders death of its power (1 Corinthians 15:55). Jesus is the only image worth bowing to. Trust him alone, and he will set you free.

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who brings down wicked kings. And may you see Jesus as the true King of Israel who leads all people who call to him out of slavery."

Judah is under Babylonian control (2 Kings 24:1). But Jehoiakim, Judah’s governor, unsuccessfully rebels and is waylaid by enemy skirmishes (2 Kings 24:2). When Jehoiakim’s son takes over the governorship he rules for only three months before surrendering to the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 24:12). Nebuchadnezzar empties the temple of its treasures and sends a first wave of exiles from Jerusalem to Babylon (2 Kings 24:13-14). 

Jehoiakim’s brother also tries to rebel against Babylon but fails (2 Kings 24:20). Nebuchadnezzar retaliates and besieges Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:1). The brother flees Jerusalem but he’s caught. As punishment his sons are executed in front of him, his eyes are gouged out, and he’s shipped to a Babylonian prison (2 Kings 25:6-7). Nebuchadnezzar burns Jerusalem and its temple to the ground and exiles a second wave to Babylon (2 Kings 25:9, 11). The charred bronze of the temple is measured, broken down, and shipped into the empire’s treasury (2 Kings 25:13). The temple’s priests are murdered and Judah begins its long exile (2 Kings 25:21). 

Nebuchadnezzar installs a new Judean governor under the watchful eyes of Babylonian officials (2 Kings 25:22). But both the governor and Nebuchadnezzar’s officials are immediately assassinated by a few rebels who avoided the first waves of deportations (2 Kings 25:25). Afraid of further retaliation, the remaining population of Judah seeks asylum in Egypt; the same place God rescued their ancestors from (2 Kings 25:26). God’s people are back where they started—landless, enslaved to an empire, trapped in Egypt, and as good as dead.

Thirty-seven years later a new, more benevolent, Babylonian king exonerates and frees Jehoiakim’s son from prison (2 Kings 25:27). He seats him at his royal table and replaces his prison uniform with clothes fitting a man of his table (2 Kings 25:29). The history of Israel and Judah ends with the barest of hopes. Israel has fallen. Judah has fallen. The temple is burned. God’s laws are forgotten. The kings are deposed. The prophets are dead. But a descendant of David has been shown grace and been raised up near the center of pagan power. 

Israel’s history isn’t about dates and cities and kings; it’s about God. And what we learn from Israel’s national story is that God does not save through nations, temples, laws, kings, or prophets. God saves by grace alone and God gives life even after death.

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus is the culmination of Israel’s political, prophetic, and spiritual expectations. Jesus is a son of David and the rightful King of Israel (Matthew 21:9). He’s the final Temple and the Law demonstrated (Matthew 5:17). He’s both prophecy come true and the last Prophet (Hebrews 1:1-2). 

But for Jesus to be the Savior of Israel’s history, he must historically die. To save Israel, he must be Israel. To redeem Israel from her sin and rescue her from her idolatry, he must embody her sin and idolatry (2 Corinthians 5:21). Like Babylon, the empires of Sin and Death would overwhelm Jesus. Outside the city, rejected by his disciples, murdered by the powers, and forsaken by God, Jesus relives both Israel’s history and Israel’s death. But like Jehoiakim’s son, Jesus rises from his exile and is now seated at God’s table, clothed in glory—not near the center of pagan power, but as the center of life, death, and the universe (Ephesians 1:20-21).

All authority has been given to Jesus (Matthew 28:18). More gracious than the King of Babylon, he promises an end to our exile on earth, a home in his Kingdom, and resurrection from the dead. Jesus promises to elevate and strengthen humbled, weakened, and humiliated people like us. And he will even replace our prison garb with robes of righteousness and seat us with him at his table (Ephesians 2:6).

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who saves. And may you see Jesus as the King who saves us from death, by grace alone."

Manasseh replaces Hezekiah as Judah’s king, and he’s the worst. He rebuilds the shrines Hezekiah tore down, erects altars to Baal and Asherah inside God’s temple, burns his son on their altars, consults with necromancers, murders the innocent, and reverts Israel to a state worse than when they first entered the land (2 Kings 21:9, 11). Fittingly, Manasseh’s name means “forgetful.” Israel has forgotten the God who saved them—and everything God saved them to be. So God “forgets” his previous grace and determines to exile Judah and end His relationship with her (2 Kings 21:14).

But Manasseh’s grandson Josiah is nothing like his grandfather (2 Kings 22:2). He is the only man in Scripture said to fulfill God’s law with his whole heart, soul, and might (2 Kings. 23:25). He repairs the temple that his grandfather desolated (2 Kings 22:5). And when he discovers a lost copy of God’s Word, he realizes the extent of Judah’s sins and grieves (2 Kings 22:11). Beginning with the temple, Josiah undoes the idolatry of Judah and Israel’s past. He dismantles the golden calves Jeroboam used to divide the kingdom, and burns the bones of the false prophets and priests who facilitated the cult (2 Kings 23:15-16). The only bones he leaves undisturbed belong to the unnamed prophet who predicted his reign (1 Kings 13:2, 2 Kings 23:17). And then, for the first time since Joshua reigned, Israel celebrates the Passover (2 Kings 23:22). Israel has never had a king like Josiah.

But it’s not enough (2 Kings 23:26). Unprecedented obedience by one king does not undo the atrocities of another, let alone centuries of violence and harm caused by Judah’s forgetfulness (2 Kings 23:27). Josiah is unceremoniously killed in battle against Egypt. His son is crowned but three months later deposed (2 Kings 23:33). And Egypt installs a puppet-king who’s willing to extort his own people to pay the costs of another kingdom (2 Kings 23:35).

Where is the Gospel?

Josiah shows us that obedience to God’s law cannot reverse generations of forgetfulness and idolatry. God’s law is impotent to save God’s people from her prophesied destruction. The apostle Paul says that the law confined people to disobedience to make them hope for a Final Savior (Galatians 3:22). God’s law couldn’t save, but it could teach Israel what they truly needed. God’s people would not be saved by Josiah’s obedience to the law, but by faith in King Jesus (Galatians 3:24).  

Josiah’s obedience delayed Judah’s destruction, but that abatement only lasted as long as he lived. A faithful king can only save if he’s on the throne. But unlike Josiah, who rose from his throne to die, Jesus rose from the dead to rule (Romans 8:34). When we trust Jesus, we are trusting a King who can never die. And so the destruction of God’s people is eternally delayed! There is never an exile for those in King Jesus (Romans 8:1).

God has not forgotten his people. Rather, in Jesus, he forgets our forgetfulness (Hebrews 8:12). God remembers our sins no more. And right now, he is making us into a people unable to forget his grace and law (Hebrews 8:10-11). If you are a Manasseh, he wants to make you a Josiah (2 Corinthians 5:17). He promises to fill you with himself, allowing you to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, strength.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to the God who judges our forgetfulness. And may you see Jesus as our unforgetful King who nevertheless remembers our sins no more."

Hezekiah takes the throne in Judah, but his allegiances are divided (2 Kings 18:1). He’s the first king in centuries to tear down the shrines that dot Judah’s landscape (2 Kings 18:4). But in six years Assyria will overthrow Israel and test Hezekiah’s faith in the process. Assyria’s king, Sennacherib, is a gifted tactician who levels several Judean fortified cities (2 Kings 18:13). But instead of trusting God, Hezekiah raids God’s temple of its silver and gold to pay off the ruthless king (2 Kings 18:15-16). Hezekiah’s allegiance is divided and Sennacherib takes advantage. He sends a delegation of counselors to force a surrender to Assyria and her gods (2 Kings 18:17). Cleverly, the Assyrian delegate makes sure to sound like an Israelite prophet. He tells Hezekiah not to trust in Egypt or her horses. He promises a land flowing with milk and honey (2 Kings 18:24, 32). With God’s gold in their pockets they pridefully assume God’s place and hope to demoralize Hezekiah in the process.  

Distressed, Hezekiah returns to the temple. But this time it is not to rob it, but to pray (2 Kings 19:1, 14). Despite Hezekiah’s divided allegiances, God responds through the prophet Isaiah and promises that Israel will rise from its ashes in three years (2 Kings 19:28, 29). That same night 185,000 Assyrian soldiers die by God’s hand (2 Kings 19:35). But before Hezekiah can experience Israel’s renewal, he’s struck by a life-threatening illness (2 Kings 20:1). And unlike previous kings on their deathbed, he prays to God—and God promises to heal him in three days and extend his life by 15 years (2 Kings 20:5-6).

But true to his half-heartedness, these gifted years are used foolishly. Presumably to secure an alliance against Assyria, Hezekiah invites delegates from Babylon to tour Israel’s wealth (2 Kings 20:13). Isaiah calls out Hezekiah’s divided allegiances for what they are and announces that the nation he’s courting will plunder everything he’s shown them (2 Kings 20:17-18). 

Where is the Gospel?

Judah will fall into Babylon’s hands because they fail to trust God alone. And Hezekiah, as Judah’s king, embodied his nation’s divided allegiances. Jesus says we cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24). Hezekiah proves divided allegiances ultimately lead to death and exile.

Part of the message of Hezekiah is, “Don’t be like him!” Dividing your trust divides your rescue. You can not be half-saved. You are either dead or alive. Rescued or captive. At home or exiled. And God wants your undivided allegiance so that he can give you undivided and eternal life. Hezekiah tried to save his life by robbing the temple, but what he needed was a willingness to lose his life out of undivided loyalty to his God. It did Hezekiah no good to gain peace from his enemies because he lost his soul in the process (Matthew 16:25-26). Jesus promises to reward those willing to lose their lives with complete rescue and resurrection. Don’t be like Hezekiah!

But even more significant is that Hezekiah was spared because of promises God made to King David (2 Kings 19:34). Even when Hezekiah is divided, God is not. He was still wholeheartedly committed to the rescue of his people, despite centuries of unfaithfulness and Hezekiah’s own divided heart. Ultimately, salvation from enemies and of nations relies on God’s indivisible grace alone.

Sennacherib’s propaganda is wrong. No nation or idol can save. The only hope of Israel was and is God alone. Jesus has done battle with greater enemies than Assyria and rose from the dead three days later (1 Corinthians 15:4). Only the God of Israel revives on the third day! Jesus offers resurrection and life—even to the divided. Salvation comes from God alone and by grace alone. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God of life. And may you see Jesus as the King who is worthy of your undivided allegiance."

David’s son Solomon has taken the throne. Immediately we’re told that Solomon loves the Lord (1 Kings 3:3a). And the Lord loves Solomon as well. As Solomon sacrifices 1,000 burnt offerings, God comes to him in a dream and says he will answer any request (1 Kings 3:5). Recognizing his own inexperience and immaturity, Solomon asks for wisdom and the ability to know the difference between good and evil (1 Kings 3:9).

God is thrilled with this request (1 Kings 3:10). He not only gives Solomon an unparalleled mind but everything he didn’t ask for—riches, honor, and a long life—provided he remains faithful to God’s law (1 Kings 3:12-14).

As soon as Solomon wakes from his dream, God’s wisdom is put to the test. A custody battle between two prostitutes is brought into Solomon’s court (1 Kings 3:16). Quickly Solomon realizes this case is just one woman’s word against another’s (1 Kings 3:23). He can never prove who is telling the truth based on their testimony. So, he threatens to cut the baby in two knowing that the real mother would never allow this to happen (1 Kings 3:27). In that moment, it’s apparent that God has granted Solomon’s request for wisdom. He’s wisely able to determine good from evil and bring justice to bear (1 Kings 3:28).

The kingdom seems to explode in response. Israel is “as numerous as the sand on the seashore” (1 Kings 4:20). That wording is taken from God’s promise to Abraham, and it’s the first time it is used as a description of Israel. That same phrase is also repeated to describe Solomon’s breadth of mind (1 Kings 4:29-30). God gives Solomon wisdom broad enough to rule the growing kingdom.  

Drawing on imagery from creation, Solomon’s wisdom is described seven times. He understands the beasts, birds, and trees (1 Kings 4:33). He has “dominion” over Israel like Adam did over Eden (1 Kings 4:24). And every family rests in peace under their own fig trees and grape vines (1 Kings 4:25). All the nations of the world come to be blessed by his wisdom (1 Kings 4:34). And Solomon makes plans to finally build God’s temple on the earth (1 Kings 5:5). Just as in the garden, man and God will walk together again! 

Where is the Gospel?

When Solomon asks for wisdom to know both good and evil, it's a reference to the garden of Eden. Adam was told not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:16). Since everything was “good” in the garden, there was no reason to know “evil.” But since Solomon lived in a world where not everything was good, and the line between good and evil was often blurred, he needed to know both. And once he did, Eden seemed to return. 

In a world after Eden only a wise King can bring us the blessing God promised Abraham and the peace and provision Adam and Eve knew. Like the wronged woman, we need a King who can see good and evil clearly and provide wise justice; not just when we’ve been wronged but when we don’t know what’s right. 

That wise King is Jesus. Like Solomon asked for wisdom and was given wealth and power, and like the woman asked for justice and was given a son, we look for wisdom in Jesus. Then we’re given a place in his eternal Kingdom and all the blessing and peace that comes with it (Matthew 6:33). And while we wait for Jesus’ Kingdom to come, our Bible contains the wisdom we need to know and do good works in an evil world (2 Timothy 3:16).

Jesus wants to rule wisely in our favor. So like both the wronged woman and Solomon, humble yourself before the wisdom of King Jesus and receive the justice and peace of a New Creation. 

See For Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who is wise. And may you see Jesus as God’s wise King who establishes a Kingdom of peace on the earth."

Israel and Judah’s persistent idolatry is pushing God’s people towards inevitable spiritual, physical, and national death by Assyria’s hands.

In Israel, Jeroboam II is murdered by Zechariah, who six months later is assassinated by Shallum. One month later, Shallum is killed by Menahem. In an attempt to stabilize power and assuage Assyria’s landlust, Menahem levies extreme taxes from his people (2 Kings 15:20). This means that when his son inherits the kingdom, it’s drained of its wealth, and vulnerable to Pekah, the mutinous captain of his military (2 Kings 15:25). Pekah steals the throne but loses several strategic cities and tribal lands to the hungry Assyrians (2 Kings 15:29). Pekah’s failures lead Hoshea, Israel’s final king, to conspire and kill him (2 Kings 15:30). Still under pressure from Assyria, Hoshea tries to secure an alliance with Egypt. But it backfires (2 Kings 17:4). Assyria discovers the treachery, imprisons Hoshea, invades Israel, and carries the Israelites into exile (2 Kings 17:6). Hoshea means “salvation,” but Israel is damned under Hoshea’s idolatrous rule. 

During this same period of time Judah is only slightly better off. We’re told Amaziah, his son, and his grandson do right in God’s eyes, although not like their forefather David (2 Kings 14:3). All three of them tolerate similar idolatries and each pays a price for it (2 Kings 15:4, 35). Amaziah is assassinated, his son is leprous, and his grandson is plagued by conflict with Syria and Israel (2 Kings 14:19, 15:5, 37). When Amaziah’s next descendant Ahaz takes Judah’s throne, he’s the first king in decades to do evil in God’s eyes, and the first king in Judah’s history to sacrifice his son to a pagan god (2 Kings 16:2-3). Judah is on the same idolatrous death-march as Israel. 

Ahaz even strips God’s temple of its silver and gold to pay Assyrian mercenaries to attack Syria and Israel (2 Kings 16:7-8). Then, in symbolic deference to Assyria and her gods, Ahaz rapes the temple further and replaces the altar God designed with a copy of the Assyrian one (2 Kings 16:10-11, 17-18).

The record of this period of Israel’s history ends with an interpretation. Assyria carried off Israel because both Israel and Judah failed to fear, worship, and love God alone (2 Kings 17:7-8). On Mount Sinai God gave Israel ten commandments—and ten violations of those commandments are listed here. Israel has entirely turned away from the God of life. They prefer the idols of other nations, and so God leaves Israel to their spiritual, physical, and national death (2 Kings 17:22-23). 

Where is the Gospel?

In one sense Israel and Judah’s deaths were self-inflicted, but death is also God’s judgment. It wasn't a coincidence that the man named “salvation” is the one who destroyed Israel. It was God’s irony proving disobedience always brings death (Romans 6:23).  

But while both Israel and Judah are dead in their sins, God is rich in mercy and love towards his people. Earlier in Kings when a corpse was thrown into faithful Elisha’s grave, the Israelite man raised from the dead (2 Kings 13:21). And by the death of God’s faithful son Jesus, he will make his people alive once again (Ephesians 1:4-5).

If the story has always been disobedience leads to death, what happens when obedience leads to death like it did for Jesus (Philippians 2:8)? Just as it was hinted at with Elisha, the apostle Paul says that when the finally faithful Israelite King dies, he’s raised from the dead (Philippians 2:9). And at the name of Jesus (whose name, like Hoseha, also means salvation) every knee will bow to the true King of life, death, and the world (Philippians 2:10). 

There is no idol that brings life from the dead. There is no obedience to another god’s laws that will end our spiritual, physical, and national death. But when we bow—or better yet throw—ourselves into the tomb of King Jesus, we will rise (Romans 6:4). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who brings life from the dead. And may you see Jesus as the King whose name means salvation."

God has appeared to Solomon twice so far, and each time God gives the same warning (1 Kings 3:14, 9:4-5). If Solomon walks in the Lord’s ways, like his father David, God will continue to grow and establish his kingdom. And so far, Solomon’s reign has been glorious. Israel is at the height of its cultural and military dominance. Solomon seems to be like his father, and Israel has thrived as a result. 

But Solomon is not like his father (1 Kings 11:6). Solomon has collected 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3). Some could argue (not that you should) that a harem like this is just wise statecraft. These women represent political alliances and Solomon’s shrewd consolidation of Mespotamian power. But however wise politically, God had already warned how foolish this is spiritually (1 Kings 11:2). In his old age Solomon ends up prostituting himself before the abominable gods of the nations around him (1 Kings 11:7). So God keeps his promise, withdraws his blessing and tells Solomon the kingdom will be stripped from his family’s hand and given to someone else (1 Kings 11:11). 

We’re then given the origin stories of three new enemies—Hadad from Edom, Rezon a Gentile, and Jeroboam an Israelite. They will plague Solomon’s later years and one day overthrow his son. Jeroboam represents the most serious threat. He already has significant power in Solomon’s kingdom (1 Kings 11:28). And one of God’s prophets, Ahijah, prophesies that he will be the one to rip ten tribes from under Solomon’s son’s rule (1 Kings 11:31). 

God even gives the same promise to Jeroboam that he gave to Solomon. If Jeroboam obeys God, like David did, his nation will be as great as his grandfather’s (1 Kings 11:38). So Solomon tries to assassinate him but fails. Jeroboam seeks asylum in Egypt (1 Kings 11:40). Solomon then dies, having failed not only to walk in God’s commands but also to to stop the prophesied end of his family’s dynasty and the beginning of a civil war (1 Kings 11:43).

Where is the Gospel?

Solomon’s life and death foreshadow both the rest of the book of Kings and the rest of Israel’s history. The foreign enemies God raises against Solomon are the forefathers of the nations of Assyria and Babylon. And Jeroboam's rebellion will divide Israel for the rest of her history. Even Jesus is opposed by the same three nations mentioned here. Herod is an Edomite, the Romans are Gentiles, and the scribes and Pharisees are Jewish. Solomon’s failures have set the pattern that Israel is doomed to repeat.

The rest of the book of Kings tells story after story of Israel marrying forbidden spouses, worshipping idols that are abominations, and dividing further from one another and from the Lord. So God keeps his promise to Solomon. He withdraws his blessing, strips Israel’s kingdom bare, and hands them over to Assyria (1 Kings 11:11). 

But because of David’s faithfulness to God, God promised David that one of his sons would rule forever (2 Samuel 7:12). That promise hasn’t been overturned; it’s why both Solomon and his son are told to act like David (1 Kings 11:6, 38). Israel’s fate hangs on the promise of a son of David who is even greater than his father. But that son is not Solomon, it’s Jesus. 

Unlike Solomon, Jesus followed the example of his father (John 5:19). Unlike Solomon, Jesus doesn’t use his wisdom to consolidate power but to give his power away (1 Corinthians 1:23-24). So unlike Solomon’s death that sealed the division of his kingdom and the death of his dynasty, Jesus’ death inaugurated an eternal Kingdom and a united family of God. 

Jesus is the King we’ve been waiting for. We don’t need to be afraid. Our kingdom isn’t on the verge of collapse; we have a citizenship in heaven that can’t be undone by politics (Philippians 3:20). Our nation is secure and the enemies that once threatened us, like Edom and the Gentiles once threatened Israel, can now be counted as brothers and sisters by the power of Jesus’ rule (Ephesians 2:11-12). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God as our only true King. And may you see Jesus as the final Son of David whose Kingdom lasts forever and who makes our enemies into our family."

Ahab’s evil line is coming to an end, but so is the prophet Elijah’s ministry (2 Kings 2:1) 

Ahab’s son Ahaziah is badly wounded and sends a messenger to ask Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron if he’ll recover (2 Kings 1:2). But God sends Elijah to intercept Ahaziah’s men (2 Kings 1:3). Wearing nothing but a cloak made of hair and a leather belt, he tells them that Ahaziah will die for his failure to inquire of the God who lives in Israel (2 Kings 1:6, 8).

Enraged, Ahaziah sends two troops of 50 men to capture Elijah (2 Kings 1:9). Each cries out, “Man of God...Come down” (2 Kings 1:9b). The Hebrew word for “man” is very similar to the Hebrew for “fire.” So Elijah says that in response to their threats and disbelief, the fire of God will come down—and it does on the first two troops of Ahaziah’s men (2 Kings 1:10). But a third battalion asks for mercy and is spared (2 Kings 1:13). Ahaziah dies shortly after knowing mercy was only an ask away (2 Kings 1:17). 

Soon Elijah will die and leave Elisha to continue his prophetic opposition against Ahab and Israel’s idolatry (1 Kings 19:19). Together they travel from Bethel to Gilgal and then to Jericho; each a significant location in Joshua’s succession of Moses. And in each, Elijah offers Elisha the opportunity to refuse his prophetic mantle, but he won’t (2 Kings 2:6). 

Groups of false prophets try to taunt Elisha away from this calling by jeering that Elisha will have no “head” or leader to protect him (2 Kings 2:3, 5). As a threat, they gather in a troop of 50 by the Jordan River (2 Kings 2:7). Meanwhile, like Moses and Joshua, Elijah parts the waters of the Jordan with his cloak. And Elisha asks God for a doubling of Elijah’s anointing (2 Kings 2:8-9). Immediately, Elijah is caught in a whirlwind and ascends to heaven, leaving his cloak (2 Kings 2:11). Elisha wears it as Elijah’s successor and asks the taunting prophets, “Where now is the Lord?” The implied answer is in Israel and with Elisha.

Elisha proves this by parting the Jordan himself (2 Kings 2:14). Unlike Joshua, who parted the river and destroyed Jericho, Elisha heals the enemy city (2 Kings 2:21). And when a new group of young men taunts Elisha for having no “hair” on his “head” (which is an innuendo about how Elijah and his “hairy” robe was used to protect Elisha), bears come out of the woods to maul them (2 Kings 2:24). Like fire fell from the sky to vindicate Elijah, God proves Elisha is Elijah’s successor and is protected by Israel’s God himself. 

Where is the Gospel?

This is one of many stories of succession in Scripture where the next generation is greater than the first. Moses led Israel to the borders of their promised land, but Joshua conquered and settled it. Elijah performed powerful miracles, but Elisha has twice his anointing and will do almost double his miracles (2 Kings 2:9). Again, at the Jordan River, John the Baptist said of Jesus, his successor, “he must become greater; I must become less” (John 3:30). And Jesus’s ministry didn’t just wash people as a sign of repentance but bathed them with God’s Spirit (Matthew 3:11).

You and I are also successors. When Jesus, like Elijah, ascended to heaven, the mantle of his authority was passed on to his disciples (Acts 1:8-9). And like Joshua and Elisha, by his Spirit, we will do greater things than our predecessor Jesus (John 14:12). His anointing is not doubled but tripled, quadrupled, and billion-dupled with every believer on the planet. And while Joshua and Elisha got a taste of God’s Spirit, we are filled by God’s Spirit (John 14:20).

God has not left us alongside unconquered borders, among jeering rulers, and in an evil world without a dose of his anointing. Just as Joshua, Elijah, and Jesus all passed through the waters of the Jordan and saw God was in Israel with them, we will pass through the waters of baptism and will know God is with us wherever we are. This is not because we ascend to heaven or because bears maul our enemies or doves rest on our shoulders (Matthew 3:16), but because the tomb is empty. 

With Elisha, we can stand in Israel over Jesus’ empty grave and ask a taunting world, “Where now is the Lord?” Knowing that Jesus has mauled death like a bear, and his Spirit has fallen like fire on us. 

So, as new Joshuas and Elishas, we go into a hostile world unafraid. Our predecessor has overcome the world, and his help is only an inquiry away. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God of Israel who is with his people. And may you see Jesus as your predecessor, who has filled you with His Spirit to overcome the world."

Israel is dying. In a visceral picture of the idolatry and failure of Israel’s leaders, a famine has starved the land (2 Kings 4:38). And a widow, unable to find justice from her king, goes to Elisha for help (2 Kings 4:2a). Debt collectors will soon force her sons into slavery unless the debt is paid (2 Kings 4:2b). Elisha tells her to borrow jars from her neighbors, take the little oil she has left, and pour it into the empty jars (2 Kings 4:4). Miraculously every empty vat in the village is filled with the oil in her small bottle (2 Kings 4:6). The widow is left with more than enough to pay off her debts and survive the famine (2 Kings 4:7). Israel is dying, but Elisha brings life to a home left for dead. 

A wealthy woman from the town of Shunem understands that Elisha’s ministry is unique (2 Kings 4:9). She builds him a room on the roof of her house and places a table, a chair, and a menorah (or a lamp) inside it (2 Kings 4:10). These are the same decorations used in the temple. They’re a sign that this Shunammite woman knows that God’s life-giving presence abides with Elisha. And in response to her generosity, Elisha prophesies that her dead womb will give birth to a son—and it does (2 Kings 4:17).

For years the family lives happily until the son tragically dies (2 Kings 4:20). She places his body in the rooftop temple and strangely doesn’t tell her husband that their son has died (2 Kings 4:21-22). She tells him that “all is well” and quickly sets off to find Elisha on Mt. Carmel (2 Kings 4:23-24a). Elisha’s servant Gehazi sees her from a distance and asks what’s wrong, only to get the same answer she gave to her husband: “All is well” (2 Kings 4:26). She only reveals her need to the man of God (2 Kings 4:28). She knows only God’s man can bring life. 

Elisha sends young Gehazi ahead with his staff to lay on the boy, but nothing happens (2 Kings 4:29). It’s only when God’s mobile temple—Elisha—touches the boy that he comes back to life (2 Kings 4:34). In Elisha, death does not take life, but life takes death.

We see this theme again as Elisha camps overnight in Gilgal. He and his men make a stew from wild gourds only to realize they’re poisonous (2 Kings 4:40). But the man of God takes the death out of the pot (2 Kings 4:41). And when his 100 men are hungry again, Elisha multiplies loaves of barley and grain, with leftovers to spare (2 Kings 4:44). 

Where is the Gospel?

Elisha was a walking, talking temple when Israel's temple was in shambles, and its leaders were corrupt. He brings life and relief wherever he goes because God is with him. In this way, Elisha’s ministry prepares us for Jesus. 

Jesus lived in a time when Israel's temple and leaders had become corrupt. Jesus knows he is a walking, talking temple. Like Elisha, Jesus multiplies food and raises the dead. He also heals the sick and cleanses lepers. Wherever he went life followed, and death was pushed back. Jesus was God’s life-giving presence in the flesh (John 1:14). He was the God-Man who could bring life. 

But more significantly than resuscitating a widow’s son who would one day die again, Jesus has risen from the dead never to die again. Like the Shunammite woman, we do not need to bring our death to anyone but Jesus. Because he lives forever, we know he will bring life-giving relief to any who ask for his presence.

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God of Life. And may you see Jesus as the one who gives that life, even to the dead."

The book of Kings tells us more about God than it  tells us about Israel's history. God promised David an eternal dynasty and a kingdom that would not be undone by death or rebellion (2 Samuel 7:13). But David is on his deathbed and his kingdom is in crisis (1 Kings 1:1; 2:10). God’s promise of an eternal throne is at risk. Will God continue to be a God of life, even in death?

 David’s second-born son, Adonijah, revolts against David’s third-born son, Solomon (1 Kings 1:5). Adonijah is the heir apparent, but David had promised Solomon the throne (1 Kings 1:17). To legitimize his takeover Adonijah turns his father’s trusted general and priest to his side and invites his other royal brothers to a secret coronation (1 Kings 1:7, 9). But Solomon’s mother persuades David to force Solomon’s coronation early (1 Kings 1:11). David gives Solomon his royal donkey and crowns him king in Jerusalem. Solomon is anointed with oil by a priest loyal to the royal family (1 Kings 1:39). Adonijah is in the middle of his feast when he learns his coup has already failed (1 Kings 1:45-46). God’s promises won’t be undone by Adonijah, but will continue through Solomon. 

Fearing for his life, Adonijah rushes to the altar where priests offer sacrifices (1 Kings 1:50). In the book of Numbers, the altar was a place of asylum for people guilty of manslaughter (Numbers 35:25). Adonijah hopes Solomon will apply this law to his treason, and he does. Solomon’s first act as king is one of mercy. He forgives Adonijah’s treason and extends life to a traitor who deserves death (1 Kings 1:53). 

Where is the Gospel?

God brings life from the dead. David’s encroaching death, and Adonijah’s rebellion will not overthrow God’s plans for an eternal Davidic kingdom. Solomon’s ascension and Adonjiah’s failed rebellion are not just history but theology. God will bring life from David’s death through his son. And from Adonijah’s rebellion an eternal kingdom will be born.

In this way, David’s last days as king and Solomon’s first are less about a transition from one regime to another but about the coronation of David’s final son, Jesus. 

Jesus is the promised heir of Israel (Matthew 1:1). He’s anointed not with oil but with the Spirit (John 1:32). He rides into Jerusalem on a donkey (Mark 11:7). Like Solomon’s kingdom, Jesus’ Kingdom emerges from treacherous political drama, self-interest, and betrayal. Solomon’s Father, like God the Father, overturns the plots of sinful men to firmly install his Son on the throne (Acts 2:24). And Jesus begins his administration by forgiving his would-be executioners (Luke 23:34). Like Adonijah, anyone can come to Jesus. Both enemies and traitors can cling to his place of sacrifice and death and receive mercy and life. 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see God as the one who keeps his promises. And may you see Jesus as the King who brings life after death."
