God’s people are slaves in Egypt when they cry out to God for help. And God answers their cries (Exodus 2:24). 

His answer comes by saving a Hebrew baby from certain death, raising him to power in Egypt, and then bringing him out of Egypt so that God might put a powerful call on his life. That man is named Moses. 

While tending sheep, God appears to Moses and starts speaking out of a burning bush (Exodus 3:2). 

The voice identifies itself as the God of Moses’ forefathers - Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He tells Moses that he is going to rescue his people from their oppression in Egypt and that he is going to use Moses to do it. 

Moses has a lot of questions, but his most important has to do with God’s name. Moses asks what he is supposed to call this God (Exodus 3:13). 

God’s answer is,“I Am.” In the context of this passage, that name means at least two things. 

First, it reminds us of all the times God says “I Am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” in this conversation (Exodus 3:6). He is the same God who spoke to Abraham and promised to make him a great nation.

God also used this name when he said, “I am with you” to Moses. God is going to make good on his promises to Abraham by accomplishing them with his very presence. 

Where is the Gospel?

The good news found in God’s name goes even further. For the whole world, ourselves included, have been in Israel’s position; crying out for God to save us from our slave masters of death and sin. 

And what happens when God hears the cries of the oppressed? He shows up!

Jesus was with us in flesh and blood (John 1:14). Jesus was with us in the humble form of a human. The Great I Am came to us. 

Which is why the ultimate expression of God’s name - I Am - is found in Jesus. 

Not only is Jesus the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he is their promised descendent who would accomplish all the promises made to them. Jesus is both the promise maker and the promise keeper. He who made the promise to Eve and all her children became one of Eve’s children to keep that promise. 

And the ultimate saving miracle he performed was not a sign or wonder external to himself, though he did perform those. The ultimate miracle he performed was his death and resurrection. That’s how he is with us! That’s how he keeps his promises! That’s how he saves us! Through his death and resurrection Jesus can say I am with you to keep my promises. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that his Spirit gives you eyes to see the nearness of the God who is with us to keep his promises, and Jesus as the true embodiment of the I Am, who came even nearer in flesh and blood to complete every promise he made."

Joseph is now a ruler in Egypt. From being sold as a slave, God has raised him up to hold one of the most powerful seats in the entire ancient world. 

But as Joseph saw in the dream, the land was going through seven years of famine. This included Canaan, where Joseph’s family lived. So Joseph’s brothers travel to Egypt to buy food, leaving only the youngest, Benjamin, behind (42:3). 

Upon arriving in Egypt, Joseph recognizes his brothers, but they don’t recognize him (42:7). So Joseph plays a series of tricks on them. He calls them spies and sends them away, demanding they bring Benjamin back. Yet, Joseph secretly returns the money they used to buy the grain. 

The brothers return with Benjamin, but this time Joseph sneaks his silver cup into the youngest brother's bag (44:2). When caught, Benjamin is threatened with imprisonment. But Judah intercedes, begging Joseph to let him take his place. 

Joseph can’t take the rouse any longer. He clears his court and reveals his true identity (45:1). 

He tells his brothers that it was not them that sent him to Egypt, but God. And God did this to save many lives, that there might be a remnant left on the earth after this massive famine (45:7). Like Noah and the flood, God raised up one man to save a remnant of people on the earth. 

God worked through the brothers' evil trickery to bring Joseph to the place where he could save the world. 

But God also used Joseph’s more innocent tricks to change the brothers as well. The brothers go through a moral change in this process. Going from selling their brother into slavery, to being willing to sell themselves into slavery for their brother. 

Where is the Gospel?

The most important picture of Jesus we need to see in this text is of God using one righteous man, sold into slavery, in order to save the world (Rom 5:17). We are the brothers, who sentence Jesus to death with our sin. But he treats us like Joseph treated his brothers (Ps 103:10). 

He provides us with food that saves our lives, but doesn’t even charge us for it (Is 55:1). Even though we killed him, he forgives us, fills our bags with provision, and welcomes us into his courts. 

When things look like they are too hopeless, or the famine is too severe, we can trust that God is working out his plans to save the world through it all. 

See for Yourself

I pray that the Holy Spirit would give you eyes to see the God who is in control of all things and uses that control to shape us, provide for us, and accomplish his plans. And that you would see Jesus as both the king who provides and the brother who lays down his life."

This is the first mention of the Gospel in the Bible.",Website,Genesis Bible Study,"What's Happening?

What is sin? That’s a big question. And we get our first glimpse of it here in Genesis 3. 

Adam and Eve have been made in God’s image, given the garden to enjoy, and are simply to tend it, have children, and cover the earth with God’s image and presence (2:15). That’s all the knowledge of right and wrong, good and evil, they needed to thrive. 

In fact, they are only given one negative command. They are not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (2:16). But why? 

The tree offers a knowledge not provided by God. To stay away from it would be to say, “God is enough. He has provided everything I need.” To eat from it, on the other hand, would be to say, “God is not enough. I need to provide something better for myself.” 

Satan, a spiritual being who looks like a snake in this story, tempts Eve to take the second option (3:1). He tells her that if she eats from this tree, she will know everything God knows. In fact, she will be like God (3:5). 

This should have been a pointless temptation. After all, Eve was already made in God’s image and had been told everything she needed to know from God himself. 

But she wanted more. She wanted to provide for herself. That’s what sin is - trying to get the good apart from God. 

Ironically, as soon as both Eve and Adam ate this fruit, they did gain a new bit of knowledge. But it was only the knowledge that they were sinners. They felt ashamed, naked, and afraid of God (3:7). 

So they have a conversation with God after trying to hide from him (3:8). But ultimately man and woman receive a curse from God. They will be kicked out of the garden and will die (3:24). 

But along with the curse, also comes a promise. God promises that Eve will have a child that will crush the head of the snake, breaking the curse of death and separation (3:15). 

Where is the Gospel?

It is truly amazing that only three chapters into the Bible, we already have an explicit promise of God’s plan to save the world through what we now know as the Gospel.

That is because the promised child of Eve is none other than Jesus. He is the one who crushed Satan’s head by taking the curse of sin off of us and onto himself. Furthermore, Jesus overcame the death earned in the garden by rising from the grave. 

Jesus not only reversed the curse earned by sin, he also gives us a way to conquer sin in our lives. Unlike Eve, we fight sin by trusting that Jesus is enough. He has done enough, provided enough, and will always be enough. You can stop trying to earn it. Satan’s head is already crushed. 

See for Yourself 

I pray that the Holy Spirit would show you the God who provides so richly for us that he doesn’t want us even going near the destructive lies of self-salvation and sin. And I pray that you would see Jesus as the promised one who has crushed the head of the snake, defeating death and the curse."

Jesus is dead, and his body is buried. Out of fear that some of his fanatic followers would steal his body and claim his resurrection, the Roman authorities seal the grave and post guards to protect the tomb (Matthew 27:64).

Two days after they watched Jesus die, two women named Mary come to his grave: one his mother, and one a friend and supporter (Luke 8:2). 

Without warning, an earthquake strikes and an angel appears, opening the tomb (Matthew 28:2). At this, the soldiers guarding the tomb faint in fright. 

The angel tells the women that Jesus isn’t there. He has risen, just as he promised.

 

The angel invites them to see the tomb, and commands them to go and tell the disciples to meet with Jesus in Galilee (Matthew 28:7).

The women run with this message for the disciples only to encounter Jesus! They throw themselves at his feet and worship (Matthew 28:9).

The disciples head for Galilee where they find Jesus. At this reunion, Jesus gives a new mission to his followers. They will travel all over the world, telling all nations about Jesus (Matthew 28:19). 

Matthew’s Gospel ends with this final charge from Jesus, including a promise to his disciples: He will be with them forever.

Where is the Gospel?

God’s rule and authority overpowers all kingdoms of this world. Rome could not stop God’s good purposes—and neither could the grave. 

Death’s stronghold, held in place by a heavy stone, is rolled away by the power of God.

 

Jesus is Lord of all, King of Kings, and his resurrection proves that there is no authority greater than his.

The angel of the Lord and Jesus say the same thing: Do not be afraid (Matthew 28:10). Those words were never more applicable than at the empty tomb of Jesus. Through faith in Jesus, Christians do not have to live in fear anymore. Because of the resurrection, death has lost its power. The curse that came on the whole earth after Adam and Eve’s fall in the Garden of Eden has finally been conquered (Genesis 2:17). Death and decay are defeated. Jesus has won.

We can trust that because Jesus rose, someday we will rise, too (Romans 6:5). There is life beyond the grave, and Jesus is our living proof.

The resurrection stirs both doubt and worship in the disciples (Matthew 28:17). But Jesus gives even more good news when he caps off his commission to them with these words: “Surely I am with you always”.  

They weren’t just sent by Jesus; they were sent with Jesus.

 

They would leave Jerusalem filled with the same power that raised Jesus from the dead—God’s Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8). The good news is that we can live with his resurrected Spirit inside us, comforting and empowering us to carry out the work of sharing this good news and making disciples.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who raises the dead to life. And may you see Jesus as the risen King with all authority."

Matthew records many stories of Jesus healing the sick in these chapters. In these stories, we see that Jesus has no limit to the number of people, kind of people, or manner of sickness that he is willing and able to heal.

Amid these healings, Matthew tells a story about Jesus calming a storm. The disciples are amazed and wonder who Jesus is, that even the wind and the sea obeys him (Matthew 8:27). Jesus rebukes diseases and demons, even the weather. He is the one with all authority (Matthew 9:8). 

Jesus preaches and heals with a heart of compassion. When he looks at the crowds, he sees sheep without a shepherd. The Old Testament often describes Israel in this way (Numbers 27:17; 1 Kings 22:17; Isaiah 53:6; Zechariah 10:2; 2 Chronicles 18:16).

 

Jesus uses this imagery to show that he is the shepherd God’s people had long-awaited (Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 34:16; Micah 2:12). 

Where is the Gospel?

Jesus has all authority to heal diseases, drive out demons, and calm storms. 

But authority is only good news if it’s also accompanied by compassion. A leper healed by Jesus understands this when he says, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean” (Matthew 8:2). And the good news is that Jesus is both able and willing to heal. He has both authority and compassion.

 

Through all of this healing and authority, Matthew is helping us to see a deeper point Jesus is trying to make. 

While eating with some less-reputable people, the religious leaders rebuke Jesus for his choice of company. Jesus tells them that healthy people don’t need a doctor, but sick people do (Matthew 9:12). Jesus has healed many people up to this point, but in this moment Jesus diagnoses sickness as only a symptom. The real disease is sin. 

Everyone is sick from the corruption that entered the world through sin, and Jesus is the only one who can heal it. His authority demonstrates that he has power to deliver us from the underlying sickness and storms in our lives—sin and death.

Matthew tells us that Jesus’ healing ministry fulfills Isaiah 53. In this Messianic prophecy, Isaiah describes a suffering servant who would heal his people by taking on their diseases and sin (Isaiah 53:5). This is just what Jesus did on the cross for us. He provided ultimate healing for our bodies and souls by putting an end to the sin that brings destruction into our lives. He died in our sickness so we could live in his healing. “He took our illnesses and bore our diseases” (Isaiah 53:4). 

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has authority over all creation. And may you see Jesus who became flesh to take and heal our diseases and sin."

Jesus and his disciples are sailing when a storm arises. Frightened, the disciples find Jesus asleep below deck and wake him. Jesus stands up and rebukes the storm in the same way that he rebuked the demons. In awe, Jesus’ disciples ask, “Who then is this, that even the winds and sea obey him?” (Mark 4:41). 

When they land, Jesus and his disciples encounter another kind of storm—a man possessed by close to 2000 demons. No person or chain could restrain him (Mark 5:4). But like all the other demons in the story so far, they bow before Jesus (Mark 5:6). What no chain or man could restrain, Jesus subdue with seven words. 

Back on the other side of the lake, Jesus meets two opposite people: Jairus, a ruler of the local synagogue (Mark 5:22) and an unnamed, unclean, and shame-filled woman (Mark 5:25). 

We might expect Jesus to interact differently with these two people, but both of them are told that one thing matters—their faith. In response to the woman’s faith and Jarius’ belief, Jesus answers their prayers.

Where is the Gospel? 

This is not the first Bible story where a panicked crew goes below deck to find a man of God sleeping. Mark wants us to remember Jonah—a man who threw himself into the sea in order for the storm to stop (Jonah 1:15). Jonah offered his life as a sacrifice, but Jesus calms the storm with just a word. Jesus is greater than Jonah. And just like Jonah sacrificed his life for a storm to stop, Jesus will sacrifice his life for sin, sickness, and demons to stop. 

Jesus throws himself into the storm and spends three days in the grave, just like Jonah spent three days in the fish. Just like Jonah was spit out of the fish and declared rescue to wicked Ninevah. Jesus rises from his grave and declares over everyone whether sick, sinful or demonized what he declares over the storm -  “Peace. Be still” (Mark 4:39).

In his resurrection, Jesus shows us his power over the spiritual forces of evil (Colossians 2:15). 

If Jesus has authority over the grave, legions of demons, chronic illness and storms, he can speak life and freedom into you, too. The way you get that peace and power is through faith. Jairus and the unnamed woman were both healed the same way—by trusting in Jesus (Mark 5:34). And that is the same good news offered to you.

See for Yourself

May the Holy Spirit open your eyes to see the God who has power over demons and death. And may you see Jesus as the one who brings God’s merciful power to earth."
