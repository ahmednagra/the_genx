I have tried numerous products to help my itchy scalp and I&rsquo;m still looking for the holy grail. I will say this gives an instant cooling sensation on the scalp and does refresh the scalp but for me the itching comes back within the same day. I do use the Aromatica scalping shampoo and exfoliating scrub and I think those work much better than the root enhancer.
